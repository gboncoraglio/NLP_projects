## Dependency Parsing

Dependency grammars are quite important in contemporary speech and language processing systems. In
these formalisms, phrasal constituents and phrase-structure rules do not play a direct
role. Instead, the syntactic structure of a sentence is described solely in terms of the
words (or lemmas) in a sentence and an associated set of directed binary grammatical
relations that hold among the words.
