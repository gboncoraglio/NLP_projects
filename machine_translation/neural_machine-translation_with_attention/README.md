# Neural Machine Translation

Here, we will build an English-to-German neural machine translation (NMT) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention.  Machine translation is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful not only for translating one language to another but also for word sense disambiguation (e.g. determining whether the word "bank" refers to the financial bank, or the land alongside a river). Implementing this using just a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTMs can work for short to medium length sentences but can result in vanishing gradients for very long sequences. To solve this, you will be adding an attention mechanism to allow the decoder to access all relevant parts of the input sentence regardless of its length.
