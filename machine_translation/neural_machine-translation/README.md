### Neural Machine Translation with RNNs

In Machine Translation, our goal is to convert a sentence from the source language (e.g. Spanish) to the
target language (e.g. English). In this project, we will implement a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. The proposed NMT system uses a Bidirectional LSTM
Encoder and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder.

Model is trained on Azure, using pyTorch and GPUs for faster training.
Training takes approximately 3.5 hours.
For the evaluation model, modelâ€™s corpus BLEU Score is roughly 22.
