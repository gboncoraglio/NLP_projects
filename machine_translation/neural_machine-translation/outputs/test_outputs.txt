You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you see in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as farmer, or clothes of leather and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> at the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the men's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I was letting me go into the bathroom bathroom.
He was doing it in secret.
three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and he ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that struggle against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> he said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults never come to us.
You could <unk> Ohio and please bring that guy that I know you have already found.
And I must tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
So we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed -- it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it made in the same.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the line.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy today that I was talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can be quick, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around my water <unk> about 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on the other <unk> on a <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or they break the ice walls.
Every iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to hold up and hold up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and by ourselves, largely as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As it melts an iceberg, sweet freshwater <unk> that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there is that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed at Greenland.
It's little bit frequent to actually get a <unk> iceberg to be able to witness a <unk>
Here they have.
You can see on the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I would like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved toward the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about understanding in yes, they're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm came together.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is attached to the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll get back to you later.
In my activity in my activity on the ground for two roles.
One of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> and what I study in this case is the way that people <unk> the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluid, the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role to performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology is not fit in the male of male and conventional women.
In the general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that don't get into the common form or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks their own <unk> body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developed following a <unk> course.
When you <unk> the baby is a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have the body something called the <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know its <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 years old, born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life as a guy, and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th <unk> and in the uterus <unk> <unk> were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component of the male typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what is known as <unk> is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk>
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with this type of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy people.
The reason why it was <unk> to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings us to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, which is a black thing to say to have African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you find a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture to <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
So imagine the amazing thing that is having children that are born like two people inside a body.
The most high recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> was put on the fabric of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to ask, "What test are you going to do to figure out if <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such one test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that nature is so complicated that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it goes to science, the more we have to admit that these categories would -- we thought these were <unk> categories that would be <unk> directly with <unk> categories, which are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out to be much more complicated than the terminology of the acoustic terminology that the terminology is.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> in the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never got to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of they put a pen in front of the nose, and if it moved on, they still won't.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> the people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets me nervous.
We would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every bit of looking at that <unk> music, and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk>
Parents were <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> it was a <unk> concept, and I got it with another that was radical and beautiful and remained for 200 years.
And as all of you remember, what our parents were, the <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old people in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had a clear idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming up by the blood of the blood that the father passed the father and then the son, and so on.
Parents were rejected by the idea and they replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all the men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the immune differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and at the same time is going to make science.
And it is very clear, if you look at the history of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed through a very vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a result, they were spreading the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women are <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that we <unk> to <unk> <unk> on the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we need to get to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to discover what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
So Henry, at the other hand, was born at term, which was was born July March <unk>
For the only fact being born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because they have a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other people's rights.
Henry, the virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man is now <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, for his hand, it doesn't have the same rights to same-sex marriage in all states, for example.
Henry can get married in every states, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories, which in many aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science was moving both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a <unk> democracy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a weird position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man -- you don't have to have a chromosome and get married with a woman you have to have a <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do evidence for the people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea is very <unk>
But in practice, what do you do?
How do we judge people on the base of their <unk>
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that we have to focus on this for human rights to people, because I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent choices about their sex relationships than the people of 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of content from <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue this kind of thinking of thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed unless they are willing to get to a change of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twin twins and then they <unk> their fame.
But when the phone was asked by the <unk> was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of <unk>
The U.S. provides huge possibilities for people to be who they are <unk> to change for the <unk>
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as I could have been, if we had given greater involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit of a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> inside the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my consultants I knew I was interested in Feminism <unk> I was <unk> as a <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in <unk>
But the more I've ever thought about the question, more of me have something <unk> in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attached to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very close to finding a way to protect people in the state of the state, it is possible that there was more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we have to make democracy beyond the individual body, think less in terms of identity, and thinking more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect person, think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world <unk> perhaps hundreds, of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they just embraced by buildings of apartments.
So imagine that half the ones that you wanted to live in apartments already would be owners and the other half still cannot do that.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules in order to avoid the <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, and you could have a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place is going to build the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to make new reform areas to contain large cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened to a constitutional crisis.
In the next <unk> elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we would have <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give me a talk in TEDGlobal.
And through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their <unk>
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They missed me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And he used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> land that in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> Talk.
And the talk was described in terms very simple that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going to be <unk>
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that for a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least a thousand square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The audience faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> Talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that could go that it could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that will help them set up and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all trust the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted on Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allow us to create these special development regions.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk>
We all play them all in the society, the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in another voting by <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the 21st of February, a <unk> shifting was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korean <unk> it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical. This is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers <unk> and then to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the last one to be the last one <unk>
There are urban planners and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that want to move in the <unk> especially in a place of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to turn to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they have to make money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside -- I'm going to make a confession a confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find these, and more recently, to photograph and post on my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I'm going to go to meet people who are <unk> all of my money goes to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I want to like the color of color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, so I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anybody have that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And since you don't know me like the woman who walks for TED in <unk> -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger,
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red pocket.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you will also tell you."
<unk> <unk> of the child who carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remind you for the <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't see that you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth, of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a very cool way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to donate it all to it.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave a lot of things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally <unk> because on the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extreme ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's another <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logical logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see as a <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you're not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in an parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, they always get stuck.
But I bet you play with that bar of parking lot, he taught him a bit valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars playing with these strange tiny particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics -- a few years ago -- you need of quantum mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit me well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't happen.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to broaden it a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of a springboard and that shows up on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would have a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip and started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming form of swimming on the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of silly things, but then when other people go up and get away from doing those things, because I don't want them to do it, or, actually, they <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
It turns out the lights then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then you put it up at a low temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their motions.
We found that it moved in very weird ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> it was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we could make it <unk> and not just react to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing and not react to the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
truth.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years because, like, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as a little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal may be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logical part that you talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned the lights up, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal just remained there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
That's more profound than that.
It is that those connections, your connections all around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head which is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explained to this slide -- and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I don't get married, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go museums, and started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we are a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better that shows a demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite ones, the New York museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around, and you get <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jump into it.
They're inside, which you want to go at the end of the hall,
And keep going, "Is it <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the data of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the technology technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 billion of the other.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have the price.
But if you really want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks like <unk>
And I got found that the kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people from <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull this image, so you'll really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump back at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to have my favorite parts of this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can actually create their own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, <unk> -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we've just got a zooming around.
This is about <unk> in the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, you send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel like by contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things do not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they didn't even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to its work of art and which is represented properly online.
And the great question that you do today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm like Italian origin all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting about the careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I would take a budget and put it on a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms coming back and they were <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
It is almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and threw it into the Moses -- you can still see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, to play Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before play.
The time line is at the top.
At the afternoon, there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
It was <unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She gives Italy, Italy, yeah!
That night they were all <unk> at the center.
You see the great summit.
The next day everyone went into the center of the winning team and the prime team then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things that we use and consume them.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, and how do they look like?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year -- to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one <unk> on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of need.
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not until that is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> one day still stays there.
So if we show it to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and a lot of great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology be the new technology, to come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop is, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves don't get open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water with water.
If you fall out the pixels you can write in them, I'll show you patterns, images of texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no door and no windows but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and he said, "Let's get the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost almost all the architecture goes away.
This is where it is working.
You see the <unk> people on the inside.
And here I am myself trying not to <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that was going to open up to let me happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water and one had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, designers, always think about using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for how people use.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> the pixels of water and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
So imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with other in sync.
We could form this cloud, way.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration, in two dimensions.
You know, but in three dimensions that what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different type.
Imagine the screen appears at different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of 3D pixels that you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different angles.
This is the true <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light is lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best hip-hop dancers today, the star of the <unk> of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's both <unk> 3D <unk> in real time and motion capture.
It can be <unk> all the movement.
You can walk around the road.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of us take a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Now, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world of the <unk> power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or emissions of CO2. How will happen from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud of the cloud of the cloud.
It's a physical structure in London, but cover from the pixel up.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of heaven like something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can enter there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that being a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> by a more precise, faster and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be more <unk> to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure anyway.
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're the people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to do the creativity?
Hands up your hand.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of all, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great generation of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called <unk> in biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution, consider this -- it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at one end, it is, of course, the most interested in that.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few years old.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein for human insulin which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same chemically chemically <unk> of which is coming out of pancreatic <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all took in the gut the more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> they asked them about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully beneficial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and dark, which is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to have no effort of their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> into the <unk>
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help us digest the <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a small note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- each cell is just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two daughters.
But when organisms come along, the organisms are going to start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes through the body, the rest of the body is <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, okay, <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, getting more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night he hits your front door to your front door.
He opens the door.
And in front of it, you find a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It's good," "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to regain the health of the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> accessible and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of us <unk> the feeling that says, Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily remember longevity.
They don't necessarily vote for the largest or the stronger or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the better creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and successful.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there was fish there, fish and <unk> fish and yet have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution that is happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and protected from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to fit us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get rid of it so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that we have to do about evolution.
A second possibility is that this is an evolution of the traditional kind, natural type, dictate by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they are <unk>
And as well as the <unk> as a species -- distant planets are going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in ways.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility and a terrifying possibility there.
I call I <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you pick up at the individual and family level.
You also think that if you could be able to choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and he was 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not so much for the fact that the human genome is actually going to make the human genome be more and more at the grasp of all.
These are those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect ourselves but they are going to induce other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against the flu vaccine in a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's reality today, and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
So imagine then only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> animal, and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminate diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes for preventing diseases that are going to allow us to also have to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could meet the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a faster <unk> that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before it was in <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take a hundred thousand years and then we can take it down to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices in order to make a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to choose the different attributes that we want for some of us but not the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
You can imagine a big explosion when you're 900 feet altitude.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day -- I was sitting on the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk with flight assistants <unk>
So immediately I looked at it, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened to the same time.
The pilot does the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane, and without <unk>
And then three words.
The three more <unk> words that has heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't have it, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I was a sentence, which is <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as a <unk> the bridge George Washington who was not very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about time that it didn't care about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my friends, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I am no longer trying to be <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental watch is <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, "I'm not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small fish.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And it gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in a different way.
You know, you're flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and so it's not that -- but imagine, and how do you look at it.
What is it that you might expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How can they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are important and you have a very good thing, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way they are going to make a <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how it was going to be <unk>
I <unk> with her brother and her father there at that very very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we will build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to the art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inside cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research, which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs after the bad words, then with the heart attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle on his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year of organization and a lot of moving things from one side to another we'd achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and we get a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring up seven programmers from all over the <unk> of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we would do something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken the frames from the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks later, we went on to the emergency track, my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of cheap sun that we buy in the shipping shipping cap and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We put a <unk> <unk> we put it up on a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up it, we published the hardware code, we published the software <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that can tell you.
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after about a planning year of planning, two weeks of dancing sessions of all night, Tony turned back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed for you to see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he turned to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what would say, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out of there so it could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go around with this.
This is a cool device but it's the equivalent of a hyperbolic <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
It all goes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine acknowledged us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is quite awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of you in this room was possible -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Joe <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something -- and I was excited with amazing people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do. If it's not now -- <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in the last few years that are generally very difficult and at the same time a lot of dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dry <unk> mine.
It's very difficult and dangerous and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days of eating only this -- very much fun in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in such awful situations with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that are going to make interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that are <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk <unk>
What was there was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to the content I could have in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company to do it.
But he said that, it's a very good chance to get it out.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If I had asked it a year ago, I couldn't have been able to get it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, you look at the <unk> <unk>
And as I said before, I had some horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> it could be so difficult or as dangerous as we enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to enjoy products, marketing and advertising, and the <unk> and that the whole film is <unk> with products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The greatest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The greatest film ever <unk> is that all at the bottom up at the end of the beginning -- it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> at the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not only going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the degree, but we're going to make sure we used all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you would give you a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've ever met.
The most great car you've ever driven in the <unk> film, the greatest drink that you have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as a part of the life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That is the full idea -- all the film of beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> people are going to be at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it is very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing for a couple of large marks,
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see how a film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> same."
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be taught.
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be me.
JK: both of them.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> -- that's the <unk> When you look at people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he was going, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we had a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you want to have nothing to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of <unk> was to present the product as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the independent media, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy that's going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually, it wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you search <unk> Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president -- even the CEOs the <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it something that changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives birth --  like that rare bear, still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare <unk>
And it's very risky.
What else is <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk>
We want a story to give us a story, but it was <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father <unk> me in some lie -- and there is him staring at me -- like, "Son, there is three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency, I want to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go out of my own, and I would have to go to the companies I would have to go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is that what I started to see is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal issue.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant movies, and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful because of the <unk> brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The greatest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you are good for this <unk>
You're ready? You're a little nervous.
I want to help you with you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there will give you one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> will have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a solid, <unk> to <unk> in bar <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have another brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind us to ask people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: It's higher technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you right.
How do we keep you cool more time? They get better than three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of type.
I need to talk to the guy from the street, to the people like me to <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Get my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, it's <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> One <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I carry on it as sunglasses, or I like <unk> and the same <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The mark I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: And in a hippie part of <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
We have toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often woke up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar.
A: Tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These guys shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we <unk> like the people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case it comes out, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that use to?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What type of roller coaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> Dr. Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand <unk>
They were <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just <unk> in one of their strong points or the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually sit down and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that <unk>
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are some playful marks and shared marks -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your brand, your brand identity, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute -- you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> attribute of it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of the <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are traditional, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're safe, stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, you wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain as well for commercial marketing centers like movies.
We went to San Paulo where the advertising has taken into the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going on the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I've had more success is the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how have he gone? They did they success?
Well, since the film was sent into the <unk> Festival for a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries.
Ultimately, this film has already started to make lead.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about to their clients will not be part.
I've always believed that if you get risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there is opportunities.
I think when you get out to people that's pushing them to fail.
I think when you train your employees as opposed to risk is preparing their entire company to stop rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And, ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go down a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data costs for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: And so I went on for transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a phenomenal question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED TED next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software in a completely different technology.
But if we can put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
<unk> enter the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
<unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these green boxes, these control systems.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had the <unk> environment, and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense to me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively looking at the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: on.
If it doesn't, it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a small and a big.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people that obviously had all the internal information in the world.
They would take all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at first was called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and structures and data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent, must definitely be a <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because that's where most infection has been <unk>
They're not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants.
I called them and I went to them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the attack goal was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go crazy to the <unk> engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you cannot be <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better than it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts of these stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in your hands.
And so it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were going to be one and same goal, but from different angles.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is communicating with six percent and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We must not worry that other goals will be <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really got stuck.
There's the gray, and the <unk> you see the <unk>
So what this thing does is to intercept the values of the sensors for example, the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which still run during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk> <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the operators in the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine is <unk> you have to open stolen valves <unk>
And obviously this can't do it a human operator for example.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they are <unk> then you can spend things going on.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> not the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> to disseminate this payload with a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such <unk> is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of targets.
We must deal with the implications, and better that we start preparing right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower,
There's one story, and that's the United States, hopefully <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give them <unk> or another one to make users of chairs to get a wheelchair and get back to walking.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that is put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other sentient beings.
This is not an <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to carry on his back a 45 pounds, and it's being allowed to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- <unk> I can give you 90 kilos for the ground for many hours.
Their flexible design enables you to put in <unk> <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
I mean, what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the <unk> look at the wheelchair, what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people in the wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with a column that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that are <unk> very quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- for a brain injury, or another complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury on the column -- and as a result couldn't go back to the 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It completely wouldn't be <unk> in your crutches that send signals into board on board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give the power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this soft, very natural <unk>
AB: I had 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down the air, was <unk>
In a split second, I lost all the feeling and all of the <unk> movement down.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope for me to be.
<unk> technology has been allowed to learn to <unk> it costs down the <unk> climbing rocks and even ride in a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change your life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but by Amanda, and all the users of chairs for all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, know their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
<unk> are together with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives with the <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, which lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by the big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- that this leads to a very tolerant society, where the deadly violence has still not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been <unk> for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It is no wonder that this destruction also put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation is making you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden in <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it like the apes, the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
At <unk> like humans, I love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
So for us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
And with him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of <unk>
And when you look at the game, you see the roots of the <unk> very laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
Play is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken out of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here is a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sex play is common both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game, like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with <unk> water.
I think that like her, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's the playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes the world that we need to play.
But let's try to get it to the maximum capacity to play.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human beings -- it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments of the most urgent time.
And so fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together while we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm being responsible for a for-profit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are in a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high likelihood of going.
But there was still a career on the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> --  came to the captain and he asked him to go out and would save the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building on the building in order to save a live alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to do the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and she brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but I had the stairs, the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> firefighters that at that height of the fire -- and he went into the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house for the owner of the house where, as they would expect, their treasure got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> for the brave effort to save his house.
So the kindness that she watched for the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as a volunteer -- I witness acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage and courage at the individual.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to the people who have succeeded, or they are for <unk> the remarkable levels of success -- I would like to remind you this: <unk>
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you something for <unk>
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood.
be mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of a concrete block.
The first concrete block was built in <unk> with a very simple <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the more building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He called it an <unk> brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> <unk> came to all the homes.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks of each person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply took the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create a much bigger and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't get in the wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the Kingdom, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is wire in the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with green and very quickly you can start to make major circuits in it.
A blue one with a green one that make light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We had this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make it <unk> faster or slower, just like this button that makes the pulse be faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a pharmaceutical collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to <unk> to use ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light light works or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
So a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island School -- that they don't have any experience in engineering, just in wood cardboard, wood and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon in motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is really afraid of the dark.
For these engineers, the <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world that we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focused on focusing on.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
Can you take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I've already heard time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some <unk> of Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk> <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I looked at a quote, but what you really find is somebody else is caught in the snow because it knows that it's not very good at taking up fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that citizens who are working with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can embrace a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a unified component.
It's a modest app.
It may be the tiniest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government <unk>
It spreads <unk>
And a responsible for <unk> city systems, looking at this app that he could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> of the tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
So it asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people stay in order to clean sidewalks up when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that are using using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> of organic and natural mode.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that it was made by the normal channels would have taken at least two and half million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
There is now a project in the University of California that even the time has gone past 2,000 dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that was program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of warning shot at the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best government ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> in the open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the matter of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we put it together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications that are <unk> every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration to that, but they didn't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we stop the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us nuts, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone don't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made up of us -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the center of telephone and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very strong music and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no center center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They didn't make that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really, really comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my cube of crap. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I would come back to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government of government to collaboration with distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get themselves and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor is helping another <unk> the communities.
If we call <unk> that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entry of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government is able to save our values and make our needs but we don't see it changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the superficial layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that in which we actually believe that we funded as something that we actually operate in our against, that other thing, and in consequence are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
It does the <unk> movement.
Have you <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk> activism itself.
And for those of us who have faced with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go to where we have to go without the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function of the government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act -- just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is about 28 years so that I, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to happen, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't really care a lot to do to hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They lay hands to the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a <unk> taking out <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumer consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that. We're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone on the last day, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the time in prisons, and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in <unk> projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that you say here is impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning with it.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family of a <unk> family, by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She took a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at it, she was approaching me and I gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I got stuck.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching me and say, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to get it back again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
It had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, he went through the room, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you about it.
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't. He said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your mother."
I <unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "I'm the second thing I want you to tell me, is that you will always be the right thing to me -- but the right thing to do.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I did it.
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South rural. I have a brother a older year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed me and my sister and went to the forest.
We barely get the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You guys -- but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing as well.
I took something, your sister as well as a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I came up with the strength of the force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't make any sense.
We can't get to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother's naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, with it, we should have <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than this was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest <unk> rate in the world.
We have seven million people in a parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In the poor communities, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of the three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or a parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles Philadelphia, Baltimore Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all young color are in jail or a parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that comes to a lot better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems to me interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some of the developments really curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get rid of rights for always if you have a criminal sentence.
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of male male population has actually lost the right to vote.
And if we looked at the next 10 years the level of rights is going to be as high as it was before you had the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it was <unk> at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for kids, without a chance of going on.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They got people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by mistake.
For every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that it's <unk> and released from death row.
A <unk> rate -- a innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow you to ever fly airplanes if every nine that you would have -- you would have been <unk>
But somehow we got rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill killing.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time they started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined his lives.
There are now older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell me pictures, <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of defeat and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time is <unk> with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not ready to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the segregation without a compromise with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's really disturbing what they were going to do.
<unk> "Not <unk> in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we put them to <unk>
I think about this.
How do we feel like a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not have it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love the entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
And in my view, it is necessary to integrate both things.
I recently talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never get to TED.
If you think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, with innovation, development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This is the connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human due to poverty, to <unk> inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we think about these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me -- to me, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me, and he said, "Now, please love me -- I'll tell me the idea of justice justice idea.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been drunk <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got <unk> he put me his finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst thing we have.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't care about it, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts of the poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, for our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not in the way that the rich and powerful richer, but as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues, about what we are.
I sometimes feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I am going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years, who have been <unk> so that they were taught as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge would take it as an adult, but I see a kid.
I was very late in the late night, my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old customer -- black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer as a <unk> white, <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I started that there were been <unk> behavior in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical ethics, but the whole lack of ethics in this country.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, just not only had it, but he had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to the cut for this stupid case.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went on the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. She walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up the stairs when I came up with a black man, was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I would get rid of the ear, and <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up with the police prosecutors who were <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and all of them, because we talk about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye <unk> I got to see the <unk> which was going to be <unk>
And they would look out the window, and you get to hear all that <unk>
I was walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black man, with the face of concern, I went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he said to me and he said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young person to keep his view in the goal of <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up toward justice.
We can't truly be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, on top of all, in the ones that share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see an obvious <unk> in this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Is it not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring, which is going to be an effort to prove the funds that you spend today in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide is not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> <unk> don't get at all.
Here's a chance to change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the largest rate of <unk>
What would you say to what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's the wrong with the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain, to steal a bicycle by small crime crimes instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats for the death of Bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police throw gas <unk>
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> six: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Several of the War War on <unk> absolutely mass mass <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Death.
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means they prefer to <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop in all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could be caused by us.
So for that of a <unk> of stories, you know, look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world goes wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> we have no doubts them.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and the long, we just had it.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income, for inflation has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people have been <unk>
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water <unk> <unk> <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would have been dreamed of such <unk>
This is a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that would take into the technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the cost of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to see two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it is <unk> in a law on the left, it's curve going up.
The growth rate of technology is at least faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The cloud, in the cloud, that my <unk> friends call infinite computing, sensors and networks, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, vaccines, vaccines, vaccines and food, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" was <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that they <unk>
And I love this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, which is available for everyone on your cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people today.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
Is it about taking that little bit and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and the technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal -- it was more than the gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of the canopy to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> and made the aluminum thing so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
Let's take this analogy toward the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 percent of the energy every <unk>
It's not about words, it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the fact that we generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents -- compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have wealth abundance we also have abundance of water.
Let's now talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager on the Earth on the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
It was a famous photo -- how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, and two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, give me permission to <unk> their technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water on the day of any <unk> water water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that it will do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this is going to be, Coca-Cola is actually building it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an African innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
It was <unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And by having a smart mobile phone, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications and no one could have predicted before.
Just better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, images, libraries of books and music, technology, diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to the business <unk>
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is the <unk> X <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> you can be able to get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the health of the health and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are population.
We just had the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion people on the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been before <unk> which is the global conversation.
What do these people?
What does it do? What desires.
And instead of economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy of <unk> and because of the use of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can they provide three million more members of <unk> healthy polite and <unk>
What about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What does these three dollars?
And if they are contributions that we can't afford to.
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams guided by their passion with a single goal of course, can do things like <unk> things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some people know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold up the protein.
And the folds shape the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They have played with this, university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better by folding protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three million new minds that we are excited to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It got it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept: changing waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I was burned to the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 inches -- the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was earning over the average of the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had fallen down in half.
I went down to the five inches.
They have an genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
It's nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the fishing fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of research projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, this is pretty bad -- he called <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in South China, and we did about everything in the Sargasso Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> the tiny little ones about <unk> remains of a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom goes from being a soft coral, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
I once captured a alive.
I still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to get it out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never used fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
We had the start point of starting the start -- at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at it something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> things -- biodiversity, number of <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes the time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the amount of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a synonymous with large fish.
They become little bit <unk> because <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we thought that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because evidence introduced in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain such as captain such as captain such as captain of the fish in this area can't be used to be used by the food scientists, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
There is a huge role that can be able to deliver a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine areas zones -- we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point is run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected ocean zone, and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which enables them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle East people for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may actually fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a <unk> simulation <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you have the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one that giving, is where to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
So we're going to see what the videos are made and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, come together in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be made famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours a YouTube video for a minute.
And of these, just a small percentage is done, you get an infinite visits and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popular rise of the past summer.
He didn't tell you to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There was a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> He published this <unk> that was going to get the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> presented with new things and interesting things to make them a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You all want to start on the end of a week --  --  -- I would have a waking Friday, on a Friday.  KA: Don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> de Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday, too.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it off, and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in doing a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends embrace a point of view and share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great inner joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the Tunisian entertainment of the 20th century, this communal involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation animation with a <unk> music.
That's the way, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, you know that there is a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats looking at the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international did.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this out of being a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What to script may have been written by this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video for minute, just the only one and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> but often there are some obstacles that prevent you properly properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and his mood, Casey <unk> I found that five million you see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new approach that we do differently.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities to participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new type of media, and a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity as well.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You can't afford permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the media characteristics -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by a single unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, now I think about it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken around history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to figure out, but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat on the dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and one marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat on the dressed of <unk> <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The highest fear was the <unk> rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing an poison.
If we were <unk> we first would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the complexity and empty and vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates who came a number of times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the Stirling engine and not being able to reach out for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and I was going to finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried to put for the men on the platform.
No apple had got the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is made of immigration.
Unlike the middle suburbs in the middle, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car line, working six days <unk>
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title for IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and there was an extra <unk> in English and math, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of half a middle of school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home.
So home, where?
Something in me <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my job was to be awake until its nightmares actually started to be able to figure it out.
She opened a computer store and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry kids and <unk> were trapped between two worlds.
They looked <unk> and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the perfect classical student relentless with what I was talking about myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in alien lives, tragically <unk> by violence and abuse of drug and isolation.
But many people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer I was picked the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist and invited to talk to sites that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence would have never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into <unk> and comfort in life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two ending the day for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do that.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we put on the ship.
There was never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What will you not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more it was -- the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all of the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing on the border of as possible.
And while I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time it's okay to be a stranger, a new woman in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it may easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will <unk> but not the way that we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, a <unk> <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people who the motto cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was making a giant soup.
<unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we open up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before you finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
My mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause and a lot more <unk> caused when he won.
He can't be able to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, a <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went into a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"They haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since that we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat there would be easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask me about the ship.
Who might wish that to you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy, of right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in a wave, the constant pace of the engine, the constant pace that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them a secure thing to do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with a <unk>
And at that time when we <unk> the great famous warrior warrior <unk> he was <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> to the ground, they could get water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me very much.
Every time I felt a little more <unk>
And I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
I looked like the technology had to allow the magic of magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, from hackers, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phone -- the luxury clocks and cameras prevent them from <unk>
Tell us our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I was threw myself into this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a device that could be able to connect the readers of the world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
<unk> text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  he says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a picture of the book.
And in a number of times it comes to me a <unk> -- the iPad knows where thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My little little girl are excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that <unk> <unk> to those ideas that we had to teach them.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And of fact, they light your way into what the left of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy on a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world transforms into a <unk> that I move towards this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all fantasy book, there has always been maps but has always been aesthetic maps.
This is a map that grows, and it gets you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it was also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another very important thing for me is to create Indian content, and the contemporary and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard from fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a history that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that we have to go out of the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a kid I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and, in a chapter, we had a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a photo of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
In this way you create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London put a photo of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and video on the video -- and through <unk> you see a <unk> group that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and be able to read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and the technology to come to each other.
It was <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're moving to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, the child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of projects from <unk>
And I think the most important thing about it is that we stop listening to the patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University, it was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the greatest problems for what everyone -- or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a shift on and on.
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I started the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, every time I get excited to send my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time that I need <unk> <unk> or some urgency of that way, but look at it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As a few of you know, I have more of 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect myself to my scale Wi-Fi and before I get up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people in their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from the next week it will be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take away from their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back and get the control of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of attention <unk> the <unk> of demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with a video.
We all have checks on <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains,
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did is we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public -- you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because they sometimes open up in a little bit of office and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> to actually find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody else <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their <unk> cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish to live on the world.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> across the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also would like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows you is still in your place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my first passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because of using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I looked like anybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very <unk>
But it has a <unk>
And yet, even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful things, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say which.
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that with a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
They're the details or the <unk>
Let's get the light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It consists of combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they are those ones that don't even recognize the things that are around our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important to get it, because in another way something is going wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect person.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom of it is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And in my personal mind, I think it's easier to create a place that grows because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made a red red house to look more <unk>
So to make an realistic outcome, I think it needs a planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful, and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one that I took from a folder, mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here is something weird.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights up.
It was more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we take technology curves on the scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve, where I say, these are the years -- or some of the time -- and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation is as fast as <unk> tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no unprecedented in the history of technological development that every few years spend orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves -- we see they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's take one of two things.
Or it's really going to turn into a typical curve, I know how to come out something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition of what used to be the world, in a new form.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is: what is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is happening the world?
The transition is very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember child the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
We can feel a transformation. Can we feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, what could be that transition that you want.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take away and look at the long-term things.
The scale of the time I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a few billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that we <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemists give us an idea of how things look like.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, there was a simple version of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate the materials from the outside and so <unk> grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms of oil.
But those blobs weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow becomes better at the time to bring the chemical chemists together, they make more chemists more chemicals and get more.
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but the things are really interesting when these blobs learned the trick of the abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were for <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to be stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people's security security.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 at 22 times.
So if somebody wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it across the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells really happy to another billion years.
But then another great step occurred in which things were very interesting in the time that things were very different, and it was that these cells started trading and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to be able to get communities that in a way, were put together in it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or so if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to get older, and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities came so much that they came together, and they decided to write the whole recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced the most interesting levels than the cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level it happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community to be <unk> and understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them a evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism -- and not in the evolutionary time.
So an organism I could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew how bad it was and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen for the life of an organism given that they had built these data processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit from them.
So the fact that the built nervous system that would build those information structures really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here by taking some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing that we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now spend through similar periods of similar periods of organisms -- our <unk> methods -- and the data processing methods.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you was taken a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
<unk> the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, such as electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process of <unk> I suppose <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without recent online technologies.
But now design objects that would be impossible for me to be <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that makes each transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine that makes something that I didn't get to, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you that I want to take a simple example.
So we found the programs that you get to come up with numbers of numbers.
Of course, some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now they <unk> the ones that are better than <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children who <unk> <unk> and the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
We had a few mutations in it.
and tries again and try and do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that are tracking numbers in a completely perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to run it to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security of the goal because they come from a hundreds of hundreds of thousands of software that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing this.
I was once in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that they work together to offer a <unk> you can't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when you get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use those programs to make a lot more quick computers, and so we can run these programs much faster.
So it is <unk>
The thing goes every time and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a moment of analog to the infectious organisms, when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what comes on.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to allow me to give up some of my fake <unk> at that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and used them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope a lot of you know that.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that I have to spend 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to take care of the first base -- not to get in time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, you really know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who from 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League Mayor of <unk> in the middle of a regular season.
Now <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place, and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's improving this year this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask:
What do you think is the average of the <unk> of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a nurse <unk>
Okay. Okay.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do is, though, is send me to the world, and I would include the <unk> of being perfect.
You'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a literary student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs studied even for a blood test.
They're which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
Out of my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the facial differential diagnosis and not <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnostic diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk>
And as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were born, then it would know everything, or as possible, as possible, close to all of all, because so I was excited about the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the <unk> lady where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room is going to come to a cardiologist with me going to this patient.
And to report the chief of residents.
When I saw the <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me a heart failure <unk>
You know, in these conditions, the heart leaves it to work and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read for.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in their heart.
He gave him <unk> water pills so that he could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't have the phone and I didn't get what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring up <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> is not a good idea. It's not <unk>
In fact, it was so useless. I asked the nurse that I would say to the lady <unk> "Do you believe he's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse I thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think being okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up the high and the ambulance and the ambulance next they took them to their house.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your gut.
But I kept working with my work.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that point, I did something I don't do normally, I don't do it.
It went through the emergency emergency service service at home.
And there is another nurse, not the one that was <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another <unk> told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear fear as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
"It remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone <unk>
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her the high school, he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> the ambulance <unk> and they brought it into the emergency room with 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
I just barely breathe and she was blue.
The emergency staff will recognize all of their resources.
They gave medication to climb your blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and they expected against all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that we never will.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left him to go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks before I went on and I experienced it for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat by single, isolated <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford to get them with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would take things out and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Shortly to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, it was opened the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I had the efforts to be perfect for the efforts to be perfect to make it out of those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an activist.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her because I was a little <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him to his house.
But while he ran the door to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> shift my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, it's an infection, but it's an infection, but it can cause the close of those tracks.
him, fortunately, she didn't die away.
It was <unk> antibiotics by getting <unk> and they recovered at the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened, and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It was <unk> an X-ray shot, but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague that was checking the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom left, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it, and when I saw some sensitivity in the bottom left, I called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every case <unk> I was <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I believe you would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that wouldn't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you stop medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of poor medical litigation and medical errors to learn how we can, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto, "Star <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked on a system where mistakes happen every day, where one of the 10 drugs would be in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection infections, are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die <unk> for <unk> doctors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we didn't get stuck.
<unk> <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow for a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath out to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story would be made up of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms all the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, you won't be anyone.
And when people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art is already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you, from the ambulance <unk> to the head of <unk> <unk> -- this is my worst <unk> blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> saliva and started to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do that.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, they accept it, and it's not really proud of your mistakes, but it's trying to learn about what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We would have the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they become errors in a while.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, I have a <unk>
And I feel it very much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I still don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to pick an American American.
It doesn't do a lot, in an investigation of a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks -- for these executives and the time that we get to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> works a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many they belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How does the way they deal with those decisions?
Today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I make a question, as I am blind, a hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you make a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It had like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we took water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked me, why never buy anything?
This is a shelf on the oil <unk>
They had more different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I decided once I decided to visit the manager and asked him to do well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses of tourists who came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> Here's the <unk>
hall.
They had a different types.
<unk> a <unk> just to <unk> just at the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop trying to stop and test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
This is the opposite effect.
They stopped when there were only three percent got to buy <unk>
Of the ones that stopped when I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a lot less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the <unk> problem is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not going to happen.
Now the day of the day, the financial savings today.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money offers available in plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there was less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that provide two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation descended to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's the unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts in the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three negative negative consequences to offer them more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, that the <unk> even when it goes against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they see them better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that incredible array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, by contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
Today, I want to give you four simple techniques that we've made in one form or another, in different research, so that you can test in your business.
The first is <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of the strange <unk> choices -- there will be an increase in sales, which is going to be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the <unk> Golden <unk> just eliminated the products for the <unk> of cats that less than <unk> were increased by <unk> by two major <unk> for <unk>
You know that the shelves on average today, they provide 45 products.
In a Walmart store is offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato <unk>
In the world trade, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a security fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there is between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't do it <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people of this audience on a vacation with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really heard more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first trial, which in the second -- but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more and longer.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very successful.
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting as we <unk> exactly as we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would tell the staff to think about the positive things that they would think of in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> 20 and an increase in the amount that they were interested in to save or what they wanted to put in their accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the <unk> the exhibition exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to the <unk> not to the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
Who are you who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a car German for cars that are <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these choices vary in the number of options that each one gives each other.
<unk> color of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order in which the decisions.
So half the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from <unk> four <unk> at 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much do you think?
If you look at the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that are going to have a lot of choices to <unk> the default button over and over and over and over again.
So the <unk>
If you're going to be a few options for many, they carry there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of changes -- not to say anything about the preferences of each other, in all ways you make it to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> we can handle more categories with fewer <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you to use them in their own business, or for the people who work on.
So I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful the more we can be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> Germany, in the East Germany, if you had a writing machine to write out to the government.
And I had to record a leaf <unk> text from the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, you could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this is going to give the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color in any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print one page, that one page will end up having yellow yellow printed on each page that you follow a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks in their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts of it.
There is really a lot of <unk> cases online that they would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
This is Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online but they do it by illegal means by illegal media, to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret service, in America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going on the worse.
In the future, most of the crime crime in the line.
The second group of <unk> in importance are not driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, and they motivate them the protests, they motivate them the <unk> you understand laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the United States national the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
It will run the <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They took the security of the site and caused a <unk>
I asked the last week, I was asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that was happening for <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt <unk> the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So the Western governments can give them the tools that they provide the <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a strong criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of the communication, and listen to the argument online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems to be wrong, but it doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right now, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
It was limited to any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Nairobi.
So these are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead in the morning, I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with the lions.
<unk> are warriors who protect our community and won, and they also are angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at the age of six to the nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions was afraid to be afraid.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it was even helping the lions to see the pen away.
I didn't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed it was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed the animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day.
And I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which you would turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a broken <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load up the battery and the battery -- the electricity in the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights out.
As you can see, the <unk> go out because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see it when they come from a night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions to think that I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having problems with lions.
And the house in the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven homes in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all of Kenya, to freak out other predators like hyena -- and it's also using it to get rid of elephants with their farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant on one of the best schools in Kenya, National School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and we set up lights in the homes that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes and told me that someday would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come in the airplane for the first time at TED.
My big dream is to get to a aviation engineer, and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions in our electrical inventions at all.
What's the next one in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I put it up once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to get it in every step that I will give my friend mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying Kim <unk> -- but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
I would sometimes wonder about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two previous weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a little boy in his arms by looking at her arms in his face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
It is a huge amount of famine <unk> in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and only only a few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also made more and more frequent <unk> everything around me was completely dark at the night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the Chinese countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves the edge between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives who were <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like like the life as refugee <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely hard, but too dangerous, because refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for <unk> in the <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there had been <unk> they were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to get away a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all their world can take it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to make a reason to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
"Where am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the <unk> to college.
Just when I started <unk> to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a lot of money that sent my family, and how my family was going to be being displaced to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Africa.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and I went into the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and talked about a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but I certainly believed me.
We did the whole way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost my money to bribe the guards <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything for releasing my family, and we went so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked me, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and he asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown is a new hope for me and for the village to get the people in the way that they <unk>
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and I met in South Africa.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, in the English community of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with familiar with the family still and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an international support opportunity.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is Center for <unk> stores of fast food, <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles -- as if this is what it is really wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles   <unk> of fast food, fast terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center home to the food places to take and eat in the car.
<unk> is that the places of food to bring people more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South Africa.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I would try to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home you see the effects of <unk> that the food system has in their <unk>
I see wheelchair chairs and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of managing 45 minutes of back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet -- three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to get it out.
I said, "Well, I can do what I get in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to go out.
And so my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put us together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, nine vegetables -- all of them.
What we do, we are kind of a paid group ahead of all the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city was <unk> and in short, they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  And then I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had been written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory on our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's a space that's enough to plant <unk> billion plants.
Why the heck does it not seem like this?
They had a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, grow your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there.
I was excited to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I cultivate my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get to see what the Earth can do if they let it be on canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that it's a <unk> and how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witness the way my garden became an education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
It will be <unk> to look at the kids.
<unk> is the most embarrassing act and provocative act that can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they were very <unk>
I, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was very close to hunger, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I am not afraid that you're going to get to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to get his <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a bomb shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave me their stories about how it was affected and how they used to plant with his mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant -- maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, and they work and <unk> all of them to volunteer.
If the kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're stuck. I see kids of color that are in this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids that are <unk> in their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I didn't get stuck.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people to work with people, to get the kids out of the street who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You get them to take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, I wouldn't call me on a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Drug Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice <unk>
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, rather than it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on asphalt that they <unk>
And especially if you go on the bicycle on your bicycle and these cars, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water rain flow down the sides and you will have a road on which it's easy to drive, and you don't have any water anymore."
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> see that in this road the rocks of the surface goes out of it.
So first a stone, then a few more and more and more, and so on, and so on, and so forth, and they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage is in this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> would be <unk> and if you get <unk> they will be thrown out of the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you get the <unk> you know, we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
So if we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool on very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow of these <unk> and rocks it again on the surface.
Today I used an oven <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So a piece of a piece of road, 400 meters away from the <unk> highway, we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and tried it in the lab.
So we did aging to samples, we put a lot of payload in them, and then it came out with our <unk> machine and then we put them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface -- they can even double a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it has to cool first before I can show you how it acts it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to his BBC on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at that time, because the news is usually <unk>
The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> like a child to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one might suspect where to come in.
We had to hide the books in bags for the market to seem to be shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go?
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters is <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> in a remote province of Afghanistan. Tell me that his daughter, my mother, out of the school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother got mastery.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> in spite of risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments when I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your house on a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you still don't want to <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the middle and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I sleep in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's for what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of an educational opposition in them.
As a <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were coming out of the way from <unk> into his village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to his home, they are the phone, a voice turned to him that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to trying.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but it doesn't harm the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to me about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of it their own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We would argue that these changes didn't live too much, after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I go back to the students in my school and their parents that we <unk> for them, I see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls in the <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother's who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by <unk> and massive revolution as well as the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> were in the edge, <unk> the each of the regime, carrying billboards for freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from <unk> East, to the west, down to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy legacy -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've asked a lot of other women, to reconstruct the civil society, <unk> a full-scale transition and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation for democracy and national reconciliation for democracy.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single <unk> I started organizing workshops about developing development and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a <unk> movement of women leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy autonomy and for our right of the <unk> of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit of time, the exhilaration of choices and revolution like the whole, were <unk> every day we were on the news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of <unk> old mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the human rights was the human rights of the human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, and more and more of it has been away from the ideal and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intolerance, of <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us today, with our success story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, choosing evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and <unk> of candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation ones.
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men and for women?
Perhaps what was missing wasn't just women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus more than the election, that just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the <unk> of the <unk> and we used to do that.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call a days of anger.
We need to start acting like agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech that not just <unk> but it can also put <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately desperately need the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interconnection and <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it was <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> that is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that spans all the humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all the villages have <unk>
And like that, like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside the divine array of compassion that makes it embodied all the existence.
This is how it says, "My <unk> spans all the things."
So it says, "My involuntary <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They will all tell them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a remarkable question, which has an answer equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody does. Why is it left?
Why was it going to be someone to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. He had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me in the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a normal <unk> <unk> where they fall every year and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the races, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships -- <unk> and said differently, in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> reason for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be with a man who loves him, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold winter and November night.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a University of <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what I was very impressed at that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field.
He had some big <unk> and the apples and a <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the start, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of mate.
He did it mostly at the beginning of it in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- which was ready that I had gone to Harvard, that I put a passion to help girls teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and left my dreams of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I had -- I left my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan together.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was getting into a physical trap. financial and psychological <unk> <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where it was supposed to be so safe to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
And another he threw it underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that a small day.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns actually was a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first <unk> physical attack was five days before our wedding.
They were the seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my <unk> suit from my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happily to live forever, because I loved it, and he wanted to be a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding, and by making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would be hurt.
I spent twice as much as our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up into a secret beach and he was <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that <unk> various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, get it off the traffic and threw me a Big Mac Mac on the face.
<unk> remained <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some time in their life, and the Centers for Disease Disease Disease informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I going to tell me.
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question everybody does is: Why don't they just be <unk>
Why don't you tell me, I could have been at any time.
So to me this is the saddest and painful question, which people do -- because we have our victims, because we have the victims, we know something that you know, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has put in order to <unk> after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent bullying -- even after the <unk> has gotten to marriage, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their kids, who usually are forced by judges to spend time not with the man who <unk> his mother.
And we still keep asking why they're not going to go away.
I was able to be able to go, because of the last <unk> up to my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everybody, to the police, to the police, my neighbors, my family and family, and I am here today because you can all tell me.
We have the trend to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say "The guilt is by <unk> as if the <unk> victims were asked <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also argue that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and make their lives joyful lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I became married with a cute guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, you would ever have is a loaded <unk> pointing at my head of someone who says I want.
At this moment, the same thing is thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> how silly you did -- but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end up with my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims need all the world.
We need each one of you understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and family.
<unk> their vision of the survivors like fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the <unk> signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe place.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> secure ones that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call <unk> Cameron <unk> and for a time, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  Fortunately, I've brought <unk>
This is the first place of clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but to find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These phones are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater for the head, because it's when you're getting laughing from me, so you don't do anything while it covers me the head.
All right.
Why did I've done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this photo.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
He was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he was going to get the back and <unk> the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or a <unk> which I made two days ago for the work, there are very little days that we could do to transform our appearance, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed for <unk> and we also have it associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now shows <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> that <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know so much about models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York spoke all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I'm not going to give it for that.
But then, what I would really tell each of each of these girls, is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron -- I want to be a model -- then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> chief magazine or the <unk> CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that's like to say that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to prove everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a copy of your studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your back, no matter what you want, if you want to be president of the United States, but you have the <unk> you can pick it in your underwear for 10 years, people would look very rare.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it was pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I came in, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, let's take things for free?
I have too many inches out of 20 inches and never use, except the privilege that I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me my free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and, of course, we got <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for you to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges in my aspect, not because I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what it doesn't matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little <unk> and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever people.
And that's the way, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never say in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my side every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the more brilliant hair will be more happy?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brighter hair, but probably it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial racial and gender oppression when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope that everybody feels more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was greater enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photographs, and I didn't go to me the <unk>
There were no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them a random one.
My story starts when I read in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and <unk>
I just happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to get us out of the photo.
It's surprising that the gesture of giving the camera the camera is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever met with the camera.
At the time, we were not aware of how much life is this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five year-old girl could be able to understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in October weekends and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical, but not only at the physical, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always got the same picture, our daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the travels -- we were walking around when suddenly it stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the Barbie store that would take a little bit of <unk>
And he described to me what it was like to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with force to watch that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets out of it.
So today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and not <unk> in approaching someone and asked him, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, like <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with the Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not <unk> the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly in <unk> like <unk> and the <unk> of the Old World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face is a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important, first of all, they provide vital ecological services, <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers until the bone.
They help kill all bacteria they help to absorb anthrax that they wouldn't be because they would stretch and cause huge losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there aren't <unk> the carcasses are three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> in places like Tibet, there is nowhere to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> The <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and has taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge amount of time bomb -- the number of time of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrific trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel around different countries, so to focus on a workplace in the workplace is not going to be anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we do.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, it will inform you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed it because he saw them fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that I would have to do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia on this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River, and teach the local and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and ...
And of course, people weren't all interested in doing that, for what they would tell you to come to work -- and sometimes they didn't have --  We were quite aware that the local in that fertile fertile valley, they didn't have been agriculture.
But instead of asking them how it was possible that we didn't have anything, we said, "Thank goodness we are here."  <unk> at time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a <unk> in this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red in the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only of us did the Italians were making mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they were doing the French, and then you see what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
Some of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words came from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I am trying to make any of a different culture as if they were my kids, I want you a long time.
<unk> I am trying to all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference to this conference put a cane on the ground and said, Can you imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to answer the 27 years to just respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people, who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it do? They <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We get together in a coffee bar.
We have zero infrastructure infrastructure.
And what do we do -- we become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea of somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And then we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once. But not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what an opportunity have been identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to you, and we work face-to-face with face, you have to create social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor for the company, the family doctor of the business -- who sets up with you in your house, at the kitchen table in the kitchen table and helps find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western India.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
So I was <unk>   So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to give you to offer you for privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they will come in mass people.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to look at you over this morning, more of this morning.
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first <unk> industrial revolution -- we don't smell it, and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The <unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we have <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
The government?
You'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a lovely story that was in a research magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the course of <unk> they brought together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk>  So in <unk> -- so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was going to be in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States were <unk> generic manufacturers were <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few of them -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to give you a absolute serious <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth of <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things that are <unk> the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell you with a fantastic financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and looking for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked at and looked at the 100 companies coming out of the <unk> world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
I didn't know the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in bars along their dedicated business -- who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who asked you, what needs them?
What can you do?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and understand better our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes before the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which is shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There is a <unk> in New York City,  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest amount of experimental properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a smaller space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so much.
And this led me a profound gratitude for the living time.
It was clear to the significant things of my life today.
But let's try to keep this look in my daily life.
I think it's easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and painted on it and he painted on her <unk> phrases of <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be <unk>   "Before they died, I want to sit down on the line of <unk>
Before they died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before they died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before they died, I want to <unk> once more."
Before they died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before they died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me some comfort and comfort me in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new new ways and <unk> it is about giving reflection to the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we made a kit and now on the walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Australia, and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if you give us the chance of ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of <unk> increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to conserve perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that make us more power.
So if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces shared they can better reflect what we care about as individuals and community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
I'm not talking about, but it gives joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares it <unk> going on.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and look at it, has never <unk>
When I singing our childhood, trying to tell you the words I didn't even know, I could remind me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me the year when I stole each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, getting pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> in society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you wouldn't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes in physical skills.
In each individual there is a different form of a different way, and there will be a different way to be in a different way.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room -- stares at the washing machine and eat anything that had <unk>
As I was growing up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there has been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, people or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift on its inside and, honestly, the search for normal is the ultimate <unk> of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher who gave a piece of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when I developed those conversations -- I felt what I would have felt like when he fell through the hole in the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care, each other, and if we don't know we understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can make it to make sure that their science is sexy and that their engineering is attractive.
First question for me, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that we study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same as doing stupid things.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise the ideas.
One of the things to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways to hook up and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> -- the bullets -- the bullets -- the <unk>
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but that is <unk> too much in the language of our brain and we get stuck.
In contrast, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple line, which is that the audience can understand if you lost a little bit, and then they will provide graphs that will give our other senses and believe a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just a few keys that can help the other open to the door and look at the country of wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English Association is <unk>
It just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an <unk> <unk> of the 19th century, which defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public office, no matter of <unk> platform, or principle, and when he won, you get it for the mere use of a monumental monumental monumental monumental
I have no idea what <unk> means.
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And this is all because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They ran into the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later, we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the North America <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired of them -- because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want the Washington to be used in power.
They didn't want to call him King for whether he gave him to her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the more <unk> the more <unk> and more unfortunate title that they had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title. It was already before, but it was just meant <unk> that I had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties with <unk> <unk>
"And who's going to be serious with a degree as ridiculous as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, and this is my favorite, and the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama has lucky to keep there waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> you might be able to go out waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you about it is that the President of the President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
All if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got his title, <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the kind of 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody is going to be going to feel humble when you say that now is President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you to do.
politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changes the words more than the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under the ground in a illegal illegal mine.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear the voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of red <unk> and rocks <unk> with primitive.
Like the other hand, I've taken a cheap <unk> of light, and I was able to barely tell the <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the branches that hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
My hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> who lost the control and dropped a foot in that hole.
While I talk to you today, these men are on the deep part of that hole, and your risking lives without paying a reward, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home but they may never be able to will, because they're prey out of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries and in 2009, and I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 Summit the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's done to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not such a <unk>
When we ended up talking to me very sad, I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me close to the stomach and weeks later, he flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of the thought about my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as a number of Africans displaced during the entire slave slaves as well.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary per U.S. wages for a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 of us are today.
But today, you can benefit from entire families by <unk> by <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over <unk> 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating in the <unk> goods of slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable people.
slavery is almost all over the world, and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and awe show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It <unk> at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire family families, in a heavy <unk> stack of bricks in their head, up to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee stations to eat, and the severe <unk> I would make it rather <unk>
And so <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back at <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side very quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't know it, you don't do here."
And it explained to me very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I wasn't citizen in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already in the world.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his liberation and he trusted him to get it to it.
When I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas I found kids <unk> rocks for miles away from <unk> into the trucks that they were expected down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids that load them and the children put them on their heads with their heads <unk> made from <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that the slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 or 17 or 17 -- because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to be <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously previously been <unk>
And they took me for a few stairs who gave this naked basement of faint <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it knows in the craft, they are local for the force force.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and dirty identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were great enough windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, as we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is all around us.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire family families in the trade of the silk market.
This is a family photo.
<unk> hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet to go out of this house someday and go to another place where our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the world's largest <unk>
When we arrived, I got a quick look fast.
I saw what appeared to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger children -- it makes sense of it.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families and forced them to work <unk> a tremendous deal in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> which his little canoe is <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and kids, and with fear, they're thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they went to the last five of the morning, but they had been working from the <unk>
On the night cold and <unk>
And I would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi is possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
They went through a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
He asked us to put it on a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then signal this path can barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around for an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> on the way ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had to fit a <unk> mass that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up on their backs and, while they were looking for gold, they had <unk> <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These mining are <unk> in a <unk> in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> on his own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have 90 meters and these people carry out with stone heavy bags that then will be transported to another area where they put the gold in order to extract the gold.
And the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look at the closer we look at the margin and we see the work at least and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, I was able to die by the debt of the uncle to be a slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in mines 14 years and the leg injury, you see here is the product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, nonetheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility -- what inspires me a lot to respect.
I want to throw a light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give the testimony of them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I happen to think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images will bring up a force in the people you see, in people like you, and I hope that the force goes on a fire and that fire will turn up in slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math, and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management,
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
So dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> dancers -- that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably a certain kind of initial <unk> that well can have a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at the time, it was a virtuous ballet ballet dancer in his time.
In the last few years, it's been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and, ultimately, the only way we're going to know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's a frustrating thing that for the Parkinson's and other disorders of movement is not <unk> and so they don't make the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic doing this. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
So what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic -- what if patients could be done by ourselves?
I didn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that what I want to focus on as a little bit of a try, you know, in a sense, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds to speak -- we can imagine it as the dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the <unk>
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn how to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as we <unk> and as the Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
And on the bottom plot you can see an example of the <unk> <unk> of ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> examinations are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, it takes about 30 seconds like a lot.
It's very low cost, and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it comes to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals for address.
We can reduce the animal difficulties from patients.
You wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
With high monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make it massive <unk> recruiting for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or Parkinson's disease, it can call on the price and drop recordings for a few cents. And I'm very pleased to announce that we've had six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have no disease or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people may not exist. You may not get it?
But we're going to get a very large sample of scanning data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we are looking for <unk> the confusion factors in search of the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this moment?
A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now that has shown that it works in the mobile telephony network as well, what we have to do is now 99 percent accuracy of accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March March in the city 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures. gray.
We were focused on the dark, in quarters of no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we can make it possible for the press all the time but some of us are really artists with talents with many years of experience and a true taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, in 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where I was the <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level reached over 24 feet and over three miles in the inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
We have rubble to the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools took the mud and we leave lists for <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photographs of photos and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places in the villages around them for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the village.
It helped clean the stall, <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the people where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor there and I had the honor of that day to clean up to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression beyond <unk> but it wasn't until I was able to move around myself.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- they were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I got on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This is the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had been <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not look like it, and that would be as tragic as you have the <unk> photo.
Over the time of time, they got pretty much photos, and they needed more <unk> so that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people volunteered to help.
After two weeks, I was 150 people who had <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries in the temporal <unk> that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could imply an hour. It could be <unk>
It could <unk> months.
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using the areas whose color and detail, the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures would be <unk> in water covered with algae and even oil, and even oil, all of it along with the step of time -- I continue to go through that hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been taken by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As one time <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky, in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she was stopped to realize that it was even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have before, we were able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and get the full picture.
When he collected his photos shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble -- quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her small children, not so small now, but their two children were at school in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took him a week to find all his family and know that they were survived.
The day I gave her his photographs the younger child was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could do to look, something that could remember the past day that had not been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them helped us clean up to hand over <unk> photographs, the great majority -- the great majority became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us get to 90 families hundreds of photos and totally <unk>
So for this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would have but the first thing we would take to look for.
So this was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, from giving someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this is sent back to someone, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a great difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- using it, using their talent to something that are not very thin <unk>
I would like to read this electronic email -- he sent him the day that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about the people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl gathered around a baby, <unk> because a very similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mom, and my daughter <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet that goes through an apple on one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames a second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technical technique that can make videos in slow motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and we really defy the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and <unk> it in a second or a second -- in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet in a common <unk>
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons inside this <unk>
What is the side of light in the <unk> camera.
Now, all this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light moving.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --   -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes on the table, and we started looking at these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces <unk> inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights to the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and current <unk> and we see it the same distance and you see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would lead us to see that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring film, of a slow <unk>
And what about how to test with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table and the bottom wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light gets rid of it, it's still bright. Not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is <unk> in your interior and it goes back into a number of <unk> a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT? at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo at the bottom, exposure, it goes into very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than a short, so I'll barely get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and so <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
Can we take all of those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> will allow you to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You get to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and it is from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple <unk>
It's not science fiction. It's already constructed.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, rather different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to you later.
As a laser can record a laser picture that you see on the screen, it doesn't make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, <unk> and we'll try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can look at it 3D <unk>
This is our rebuilding here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is on the turn of the curve, right?
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected in the open windows of the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see inside the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood that's quite hard, so actually this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of visualization to solve the problems of mammography models in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, he became science in art, a art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all of the data scans that we collected every time is not only for scientific visualization, but we can be able to figure that we can be.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and <unk>
And if you look at those ripples -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> a second.
But here it also happens a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these will go away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events in the world is sometimes invested in the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can take your life, and gives you freedom itself.
And with a mobile phone can be <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
You can record a song, and put it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
So this is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that we were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who are a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> One Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a cell phone.
But today, I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information.
<unk>
So why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This is what this says that every European telephone company, every single service provider has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who's called <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who's sent him a text on the who.
And if we use mobile mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and even two years old, in their telephone company or your Internet service.
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers and the Internet providers, is all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, all they said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out on the streets of the Berlin and they said, "You don't get <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be the <unk>
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Whenever I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for me would give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to the door, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a demand on court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, I agree.
We have the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand dollars and five <unk> 30 percent of the data.
At the beginning I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge model.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open coming. City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and butt out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other one, and then we ended up with this big network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate with each other, what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and even two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, you had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin in Berlin may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and businesses want to store so much information about ourselves as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of following our lives and want to look at them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come back home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not <unk>
When you go home, we get to the representative of the fact that businesses and the state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that teaches them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. Isn't it genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that was at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of women, and I don't want any of the present ones.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> of Christmas, are at the commercial center, driving on circles and what do you see?
16 places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C. is just one of them.
If there was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal of gold.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park, <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial age.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, you can do it.
So a lot of people with cerebral palsy, didn't get rid of it, but my parents don't believe you think about it.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you do <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents would come to the school system and get rid of that I also went, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- I then then put it on my mother.
My father taught me how to walk to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
And another tactic I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten of the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and keep all of the family --  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as a campaign.
The people that I grew up with didn't have problems with my faith.
But nevertheless, it seemed like a lot of <unk> of starvation during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so <unk> from dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or so I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we get rid of <unk>
In the summer vacation I was often trying to <unk> so I would drink milk <unk> so I was drinking warm milk on the back, I was struck by the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, "You know, <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I did yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up, <unk>
And now I can get it on the head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college with the university discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> in the theater department.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of least smart, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and in their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four words: <unk> I finally got a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of it -- finally, <unk>
Thanks to God <unk> I am a <unk>
I didn't have the role.  They gave him a <unk>
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, crying -- historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, asking for why and she told me why they thought they could not do the stunt stunts
And I said, "Well, if I can't do the stunt stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper for which they literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled papers.
When I graduated back home, and my first tour, <unk> was an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
But instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> doctors, not white, with disability.
They just give perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, he took him famous briefly from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he was going at high speed on the <unk> of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in Europe across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I don't like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York City, now in its 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
It was a lot easier to fight the Arabs were much easier than fighting the <unk> challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was the way I was invited to the news program, with Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduation dance, and I went back to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the desktop of the speaker for not to go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they didn't go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like <unk> and printed my chair.
One thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and no longer <unk>
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
So <unk> clips is like, "Why do we <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk>
What disease is that?
We really should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair cannot be able to <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that you don't know, but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We may still need a whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came up with the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children Syrian Syrian refugee -- a tiniest part of what my parents would love me.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
The <unk> <unk> the little people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunity, there is no work, no <unk> in the future.
He just lived in a tent, in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, and <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They presented with a young guy.
They finally came home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky gives a bomb.
That child in that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist group, and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a connected terrorist organization to the Qaeda.
So how does the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he came back.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban youth that <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't engage in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't tell them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to <unk> to be the history of developing cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, "Well, if I never would have gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have turned into <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a young leaders at a business point.
We were going to go back to about 90 juvenile leaders, the <unk>
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
And I remember when he told me when he was a graduate graduate student, frustrated, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, for <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A is the <unk>
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is that story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the corporate spirit may be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young men to be the <unk> of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until he came back, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk>
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, young people, they can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he didn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact in young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
And the encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So then, to inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurship is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to be able to deal with the development and put it into your business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park, in the <unk> is how it's called, when it is created, when it is created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids in the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is that my suggestion is to become young in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation and will have more stories about flowers and the Parks of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
It was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> <unk> an area in the north of New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we were <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something nasty.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> from about four square feet with the hearts of <unk> <unk> balls and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought was going to clean his <unk>
That question followed with me, and he was getting a little bit of it.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where do you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of clean <unk> our trash, which is about 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products, every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked around his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was the <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as subject as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk>
It takes a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for a number of years and their bodies kept <unk> to the weight of their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Philippines, <unk> the garbage collection is one of the ten <unk> most dangerous <unk> and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and coming into traffic all day and pass it around.
They just want to look at it, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to take away from their <unk> and their dangers inherent us in very real ways.
We have controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing that we have no space for what the engines of the economy start to fail when it's endangered the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just put their relationship.
And then there's what I call the average speed of a daily necessary.
So I mean by the speed I mean by the speed that we used to move in <unk>
We are usually not going to blame us, and we cleaned up with us or we carry our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will take out of that.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every single day in a <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work enables us to make our work.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep us on is safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must stay in form or another.
I heard one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs going, and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper and he did it all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day in particular, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that I started to investigate waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
<unk> waste, what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to be clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis of different analysis become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center, in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis librarians.
This is the kind of construction that we showed us like to my team and me, what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After looking at some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of the crystals generates heat in the interior, so it is necessary so much.
In a city where this is not supposed to happen because it's a temperate weather, that's about 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, its one has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth of being a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, in several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city, where most of the buildings we see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating on an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the posts of the building.
And this spreads out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that is <unk> by its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that was going to get to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have a properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me have the <unk>
We're building that with these little little pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light from inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this market idea was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because it had more local to sell.
And in addition to the idea of the facade -- it was more economic -- not only because of the material in comparison with the glass, but because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy power for the building in a city where the electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of urban meeting.
And these <unk> on the roof, which we collect water for the <unk>
They're waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth ground floor.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access door connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design experiment that we did was to broaden the existing streets, creating 12 initial building blocks similar and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick up some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this will change the initial model.
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we had a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the <unk> we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to the local norms that set up a greater density at the higher levels and a lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space in the project is almost like giving to the community occupied space for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and <unk> and make such activities like running a two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment that have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge very bright amounts of hair, and a little <unk> of cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of his, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in my time after the <unk> was a little bit later and I hid in the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took from my master's table to my master's book.
And then I did.
I took the grades of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit like this.
All the things --  And I set up to give me the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other classmates, had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row in a row -- just to be there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at me.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It was all obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I'm going to tell me, the reason why I was bothered with this little girl that was so small, it was so small for <unk>
I have the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of murder murder in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that was going to take the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the lab that you study the <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no norm, <unk> would have been literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> no 1,000 and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without it, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, as far as the creatures -- almost as all of them.
This year there are 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from ordinary <unk> and so on, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget about the relentless that it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious that the creatures that get reduced to the person to their desire, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel silly, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being to the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details would be in the <unk> right?
The <unk> make all novelists <unk> and that's something that they were understood.
All she does to give me pleasure could give another another, maybe right now.
And it starts to be said to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> senses on your lover -- you add it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> information is <unk>
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like great piles of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of a sudden listening behind the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of their lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the performance of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make it seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge -- a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> -- the more painful -- the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a whole range of feelings that are much more profound and vital that a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal us to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at very <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was being used with the idea that his wife <unk>
And Freud says there was something bizarre about that man, who didn't get sick at what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
And the novels really describe how <unk> they make us look very <unk> but without accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we become residents in the fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal acts.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman of Michigan was about 52 years of age, he was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since the text messages was sent <unk> by itself, for a year.
For a year every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How a huge deal of creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> in the <unk> and once we are in the sphere in the sphere, in the realm of mankind, the membrane that it might be, what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his more famous character.
And Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to get from your being and <unk> from what some time <unk> and it's under the floor -- you get your rings, you take your <unk> your cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you are in a mystery.
Let's go to Baker Street and asking for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but she loves him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> I wouldn't want to take your hand up.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be trying to treat them as a problem with <unk>
You know, in a minute -- it's the opposite side of <unk>
By the next minute, they're the same side.
All of a sudden, it's allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the greatness of another.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It's just the fiction <unk> the jealousy.
<unk> used to the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet thing is, the sweet thing Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
So the 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> Department of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface surface was the culmination of a collective process.
And the Apollo program was the largest for peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave it to a 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of the surface, which we Aldrin took after 11 Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we care?
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do I <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because the president Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why does it work?"
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would you climb the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why will we fly over the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> of Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West about the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the transcendence of technology powers.
They were because it was something great to do that.
The landing on the moon came up in a context of a long list of compassion <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have the technology that Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with the candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew for 40,000 miles per hour.
From 1970, any human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> crew <unk> and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the technology that we imagined technology would like to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have been <unk>
I remember the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't get to the <unk> escape from the rocket -- Saturn Saturn <unk>
I knew how this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that is where it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists were <unk> and they had enriched toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't recognize the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation for Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious businesses than the years that they were <unk> tradition, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to <unk> by the funding problem or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investment investments, other investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest in the benefit of technology as energy, which need a huge amount of capital and that development is long-term <unk> also not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons why we cannot solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you go to it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we cannot solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global consumption of energy is from energy sources like solar energy, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price.
Now, businessmen, the entrepreneurs and the economists agree about what policy and international treaties is that the development of an alternative energy development, a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in political climate that we will see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the great problems that seem technological, it's not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be enormous, while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon declared the war in cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly damage to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability for technology to solve great problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> hard and dangerous and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas, which is about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to thinking that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to the opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there are not many evidence of it.
I mean, the people that <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politics, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago they are still pretty good at nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen on the street is almost half the road.
But it's this evidence for enough?
What the record opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people have when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
You probably ask for the question, "What do you ask to do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them, but in the other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel by a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we had those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust as a more <unk>
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence level because they try to <unk> the good inherent judgment of the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
I think it's a stupid goal.
Isn't that the goal that I <unk>
I <unk> to have more confidence in what it is -- of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I believe that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, that means that it means that what it matters in the first place is not the trust, but the trustworthiness.
What is this is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the commodities -- and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if on the contrary, they're not allowed to, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see it will be <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do to talk before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and others, and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> than going to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and I think that the accountability system that is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the testing of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you have similar examples.
So let's get all that, for the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we try to be a sense of confidence and tell the people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task to reconstruct trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we reconstruct a little bit of the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the confidence.
But trust, ultimately is signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford to, usually for all people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
That is a day every day, everywhere, the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions -- very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can tell you without giving explanations for.
I wear them and get the money, or they change it for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson there.
If you come back to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been becoming increasingly and more and more, to a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to figure out how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into digital space, so when the strong wave against the screen is that it transfers their physical body to the epidemic.
designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a little bit of chambers of deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can get the hands of the keyboard, and get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the online touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come into us?
It took a lot of us to be afforded to buy and design things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of only seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists like we can be physical and <unk>
How would a future be?
At the Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, this unique physical pixel itself.
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically, physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can reproduce it as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike <unk> or the text, or the text, this is a real and palpable experience you can play and feel.
But what is more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> ourselves from our world.
So we started the talk today by talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that stays our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my mother mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believe firmly that there was only a difficult path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
Is it not matter if I would like the work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera student.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer needs to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult will tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
My friends, my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life an happiness happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me like <unk> Okay.
They went back to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but very strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And the encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit.
A lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Now, comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's the research fields as comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers <unk> a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For the Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> duty. Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of getting lost in translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books they opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I won't go back to feel like <unk> or <unk>
Having a <unk> sleep, really is not anything compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place of dreams, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream, you can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex I walked into the first session using a jeans and a <unk> <unk> he threw up on my <unk> sofa, and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> made me easy just to move his head while we get the solution.
"The <unk> new <unk> said Alex, and so I was looking at it, she was right.
You start to work after that, you get home after that, it has children later, to death later.
In particular, as Alex and I had time to <unk>
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with the guys under her category, it was <unk> with a <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get away with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they had, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in your development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of recklessness was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only to Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think that no one gets to adulthood without going before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your sleep a <unk> I want to look at it -- it's good. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my mind. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of <unk> that give you a way to their life have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in 40, I don't go to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an interesting impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change in themselves, now is the time to change it.
We know that the personality more times during their <unk> than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility arrive at the top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday life and common life has an impact on the person that is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the time line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence of the <unk>
<unk> journalists <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not happening.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and is absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days, <unk> intelligent, interesting people like you or their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not to account. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it crashed the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stand up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the '50s and so many of you start a career, choosing a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's some research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do all over the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying robotic sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to do now.
He says you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, what happened for the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
You know, often in our <unk> but then she was getting up, "You don't choose your family, but it can pick his friends."
Well, one day she came up with her head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his lots of <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that's followed after the <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while sitting while the decade of Emma, he was going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told her, three things that all <unk> man, or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told her to Emma, that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company you want to try it.
I am not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't be able to count, which by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it wrong.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you back to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to you who know what you know about, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from the most close circle.
The new things come from what they are called weak <unk> friends of friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs was never <unk> so to meet the chief of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published then.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma would soon give his family when he has a couple and form his own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose their family had come.
You might think that 30 is better to sit in mind that the 20 or even the 25 or even the 25 or even the 25 and even the 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or tell you now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that implies being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice from who and what they want instead of just to do to do or kill time for anyone to get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fourth quarter of a cousin who worked at a art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a work there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who live on life.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent a letter to say, "Now the emergency room of emergency contacts, are not enough enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles Airport who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the 25 or the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> the <unk> the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital of identity, use their weak links nominate your family.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't.
You're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job at management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics for <unk> <unk> in New York public schools.
And as any professor, I took tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, I would raise grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest children wasn't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a psychological perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing that we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who's got success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, which teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the results of their <unk>
We associate with private companies, asking you what these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who will make more money?
In all of these very different contexts emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started to study the determination at the public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my password questionnaires and then waited for about a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher than <unk> even when they put them on every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> tests even safety that the children were when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for the risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we build determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related or it is even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to get to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the shape and the shape of the Chinese character.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each one of the drawings of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> a <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand how basic literacy is.
The first 200 to allow them to understand the 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you may be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who goes to a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like if I was shouting in a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> the form of the flame -- but I like to believe that it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of gates of a <unk> in the old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe a lot more characters.
One person person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the ancient said, two are company, three are a crowd.
If you put a person in your arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> together, it gets very hot.
Three fireworks, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun goes on on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, have care is <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every small effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains, one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their politicians beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has turned out.
A mouth that tells you where it is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and lower the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician magician together.
The film is the imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a very bright dress and bring a magic bullet.
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex of child fantasy program.
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl in dresses like the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the Oz magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I believe that if the Oz magician, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic in magic to defeat the armies actually generated by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz magician is that the most amazing characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did I see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so she slid in the room and was impressed like a mom and his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but I would get rid of it all.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be the issues of value, resilience and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke one to an army to <unk> government <unk>
<unk> this with the <unk> Oz magician in <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your film?
They do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up -- OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital -- force in movies for our kids, and so little in the way of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know about the experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss.  I think at the time of the first minute, I was hoping that credits of the credits actually started coming out because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb, animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> to anybody of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, boys, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when teaching girls how girls are fighting against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, as real and lovely like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all the time continues to appear in classic after scientists, each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
As much as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies passes the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't been roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who will have lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations is about something more than the kid that you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success to <unk> a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood <unk>
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a <unk> where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the treaties to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 movies, most popular movies, how many of them believe that they have foreign protagonists
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we've chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
So this is what he was saying.
In the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it is the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I listen to that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero, is defeat the <unk> with violence and then getting the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to look at it.
We have tools to our willingness as <unk> <unk> and we hope that it will happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their <unk> power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I refer to the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is completely changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of how we care about the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what he was his favorite character from "Star <unk> you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to make their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I would tell my <unk> Go and fight just and more stories where they see that their work is to join a team, perhaps a team that is led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the <unk> magician like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living on Maine and one of the things I liked was to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to get me to <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach beach in Maine, had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles away along with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew it had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the Eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in plain sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process using infrared color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years in a time period called the Ottoman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire. There was this great revival of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try and find the random equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where they did the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for us.
Five meters down, underneath a <unk> thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of a number of years that date out of the Middle Empire exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs -- quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not very much, but when we think about the most common stones used on the jewelry, of the Roman Roman -- these are the stones that <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a database of elite jewelry, which proves that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's get to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire which was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the most of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas that have really started in 1984 B.C. B.C. at a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that it is made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race race and go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, are <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide up against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around the wheels that goes on on their side, the rays on the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
By the lobby, or what the other side of the door, and what the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse on a brown hole.
It's a horse that you're talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> making your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're about to get into the mouth.
They went on one side and enter your living room.
So in the room, and doing most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing, dancing on his <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now <unk> the kitchen.
The ground has coated with a yellow way and from the oven. They come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
We had the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize faster the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man called Ed Cook who had come from England and have one of the best <unk>
I asked her, "Do you know when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous memory acts using old techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "Well, how do you have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall in the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> and brilliant English, but a little <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do they memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the <unk> <unk> <unk> film <unk>
We went on one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on coming back, a number of treaties on the memory of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having <unk> <unk> disciplined and <unk> it wasn't as rare as it might look like a day.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would argue that they have changed cognitive lives.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do that.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is the skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory shops, the lab.
They wanted to be able to have brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was no really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in a binary MRI machine, <unk> your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of the snow -- they found that in the memory champions are <unk> different parts of the brain, different than others.
They were <unk> or looked at a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> competitive is driven as a armed race where each year is someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It was illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox. It says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word -- I tell you about you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's their <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you have a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back later, and I asked them to give them a word that I told you about a <unk>
Do you know what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his work is <unk>
The same word of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name is, Baker, really means nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> hands.
They were good when they come back home from work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when I took that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about a half thousand years ago in Ancient Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring to a <unk> you would get to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But not only killed them, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, the only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting on every single <unk>
He took the family of the <unk> to where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What I <unk> <unk> <unk> in that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we are not good at remembering names, or phone numbers or instructions or a word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual and extraordinary spatial memory.
If you asked them to give me the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be able to do that.
But I will bet that if you tell them to say who I was sitting on the horse is a brown speaker in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember the more <unk> I think, <unk> <unk> and <unk> the more <unk> it will be.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the earliest memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to do it by memory, the same way that I would have done it -- if you would have been invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy picture and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your home, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then he would see Britney <unk> to remind that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then I could go in the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help him remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives for not word for the word that is going to confuse it for typical for typical.
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something massive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing happens is when someone else gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school kilometer in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was quite hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of some security <unk> with tape leaving it just two <unk> because the distraction.
I ended up coming back at the same competition that had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be able to put it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to narratives and the phone numbers and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it comes to a gift -- but it's not the case.
Great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We are going to focus on how we focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make it happen.
It would be sort of deep processing -- a kind of full attention that most of you are not going to go down there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to be so <unk> we don't even care about it to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex topic, so we <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because it does 30 years ago, I was a <unk> country, I was living there at my parents home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that was going to be the living room.
And there everybody was looking at the television stage, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, all of me -- and every time I went back to me, and I went back into a towel -- everybody got to me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
I would take that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, or division of areas -- but of those connections, emotional connections, which we feel in the places that we do.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
And this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they would tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it for based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> who ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> what they <unk> is to communicate with this <unk> the children, the ownership values history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle. It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new type of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are very different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to do it and we gave them so much, that we get completely away from the people.
And all of the color black, this is why we think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go to the other side and come back to the other side with those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we are all happy, so we started to experiment with <unk> we do the <unk> and over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Very hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to bring those symbols.
And you get the <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We took those ways that we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned it into skyscrapers -- that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
nuts.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be to the <unk> to the French or the Italian thing.
Maybe with a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, different memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started doing the <unk> <unk> in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We have the symbols that are <unk> now we have new design techniques that we have been through a computer, and we find new ways that they were <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something was <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public and public and general audience were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles -- Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody thought that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium country with other star architects.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, would have to be walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can be <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications eventually has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very much time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we know if the one that designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this, because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen, because we're on the threshold of the most revolution in architecture from the <unk> of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, and the media is that when you apply it to both extremes almost in <unk> and it is effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, the architects, and the <unk> the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to reach and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes you deal with collective memory and to upload these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built on today, first to <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the <unk> people and tell them that there is no unique response to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
architects are no longer like the mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is not a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another, it's irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only <unk> and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do sports or for <unk> or even one can get married there at night.
This means three architects can dream with swimming in the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, is not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that we build our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we've built.
The architects already know how to make buildings more and more friendly and more friendly.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not at opposite sides.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most unequal spaces -- the local libraries -- the homes where we do our kids, and the step of the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does that very typical kind of typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he asked me to think, when's when I stopped doing this?
How do we all are not to love with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
And the one that his mom says and what your friends, or teachers say, you don't know who to believe.
So it does a video of it, it publishes it on YouTube, and asks others to please stop a <unk> "I'm nice or a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal and normal teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their life most vulnerable to emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We never have been so connected in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that they go from hand with that is <unk>
This environment, that is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide between a life in online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what's been rigged about.
What is the hardest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now one routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to do with what you compare the young.
But the kids aren't immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars, and the singers who are <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals right now.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls would rather not do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how to taxpayers to society and the field of labor development.
<unk> -- almost one of three percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class debates because they don't want to call attention for their physical life.
One in five are not coming at classes for the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season -- if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't believe that you are thin, you know, a lower note on the average of your partners who don't care about that of the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
It is regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be very clear, we are talking about how you see you not just how you're really being like.
The <unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they're involved in more healthy diet than you can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, diet surgery, aesthetic sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual sexual relationships.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that need to be like to be <unk>
<unk> this potential is to interest in each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are <unk> <unk> for anyone willing to provide an education on your body self-esteem that will work.
One education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the business, and let's be a better model to keep the women and girls in our own lives.
We defy today's status as women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not great beauty.
We need to start to judge the people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the feedback that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and companies and companies to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to <unk> all of their human beings to spend the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who really make the difference in a <unk>
to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go on the big screen because we can just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they see that they will never be able to be the ones to be who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who has on your mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is two car seats, what would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- more <unk> a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this, and we would recognize their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with the images is <unk> all of us.
But let's give our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that the love of the people who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It will lead to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a age of age, they become becoming agents of safe success agents themselves.
Let's do it.
On November 11, 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially they said innocent but being imprisoned in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters for the United Nations.
Luckily those plans was taken by an informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be used to.
He was later <unk> he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had a <unk> mother with <unk> elementary school in the two made it all possible for giving me a happy childhood to me.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
By the experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of all, in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of the people who think that they <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the means possible for everyone to live as well.
A few months before the arrest did, he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point out to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that <unk> gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise everybody, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned into the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a son.
In all of us, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they found them so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a stick with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and injured to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood, allowed me to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone already a time to pack and get to another city.
As it was always the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
It was secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the white, but to be the new class in the class silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to say <unk> to grow <unk> I wasn't ready for the real world.
<unk> I was <unk> opera to people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put together in trial was for the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the theme of youthful violence, like I had been a <unk> victim almost all my life, was something that I felt like a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the guys who had done, friendship, Jewish was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend and I was downright proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been done to me to believe was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job at the Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> I developed a sense of empathy toward the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> people, exactly the way that I wish would be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be dumb, but I know what is going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
And in many ways, he became my figure out at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was thinking, and she told me something that conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope someone else who's going to try to bring in violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism <unk> against those <unk> acts like rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which kids don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like the moments of your childhood that you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film and you, you and tea.
There's nothing to be more directly directly.
At least I know I have a personal awareness.
I don't have any certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just <unk> robots that we get to make results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness in science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
science, by nature, by nature, is an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science, it's an objective of science,
consciousness, for nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost the 20th century, we would have that vision.
psychology was studying <unk> behavior, studying the neuroscience -- but never just mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to get the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, an blooming of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that he presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science issue.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work in neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Without <unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, not the true core mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an inner movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how are the <unk> how do they adapt and adapt to living organisms and are all questions about the target working.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about how we talk about, how do we play <unk> all of these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior is between easy problems.
But the difficult problem is the question of why it's all accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms, that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful string of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, the physics is explaining chemistry, it explains biology, biology explains biology, explains the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
For another, we don't know how to try that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I believe that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, and I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and then it studies everything that needs the explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely <unk> theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply denial that the observation of consciousness, <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
And in the time we get it, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws than the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties do not explain in terms of nothing more fundamental.
On the contrary, they think of principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, the <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws of Newton. Then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass, <unk> then for logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, an fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not that the object of science, is not that the object of science is.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, space, time, the <unk> physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by mind, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, the dogs, the <unk> the flies, the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that the photons are smart or it <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when they think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thought of thinking is that perhaps photons can have some kind of crude feeling element, some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
This is partly from the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, and mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the human cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
And a deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we have to think about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human, complex awareness.
It turns out of simple information, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible level of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a means of information integration, the same very significant, degree of very important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
physicists and the philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlies us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> vision of the physics equations you can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to make our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I wasn't supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think you think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated data processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problem on the ethic of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, a group integrated in a TED level, at this moment we have a TED consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of <unk> different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer at the first crazy idea that consciousness is something fundamental than the second thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way toward a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was <unk> with my friends, I would love me with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a evident.
She's not gotten anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing could be considered like an achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> so just after about 20 minutes in the class, I got a guy up and said, "Hey, when to put your <unk>
I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about <unk> law for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
"Of course, in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we don't know it, and it's not about the guy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our <unk> or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage scenario -- what I do in this chair of the wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to get it? Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to get it up.
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold to the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make a phenomenal thing.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without drawing with a pencil held off the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we will give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would have the <unk> in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been talking about bizarre <unk> expressing that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration -- and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to stand up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see you and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
We have a few things.
But the things that we do: aren't the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more <unk> because of society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of lying, because they have been sold to this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "For God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm younger than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall to me --  -- <unk> the neat trick of how you can load your battery battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs hasn't made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen, will not make the subtitles.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books into the <unk>
It's not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people who are disability to be <unk> to stand up with the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 12-year-old kid in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a user to wheelchair.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football, with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I will let them experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would play with your imagination.
We can use Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it's run by the game of the game to 160 percent, blood beating the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to get it up with all its self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I had some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk>
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of <unk> from the University of Washington University.
<unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know about.
The <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not rocket cheap.
And I'm going to show you why by why with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! Not <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan <unk>
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball back to the fund of the network? Or do you get a <unk> in <unk>
What will be their experience when they <unk> a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it for <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So here's a quick review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his <unk> of the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, more rapidly.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player going to your group, and you see your next hand you shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have in there, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't keep their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to <unk>
If you lose parties, you get <unk> like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just an augmented strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your own game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have the information <unk>
This is going to be the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being in order to be done.
It will be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they are <unk>
You put the ball and <unk>
It took a open engine, all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> you will get a thrust out of it.
<unk> the <unk> but you get stuck.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land, but the receptor looks at its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
He <unk> catching the <unk> running <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: do we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to make empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how does your actions be from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more in space and science rather than <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, we face, as always, as well.
Thank you.
I was <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, the South Side of the Lofa County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and his architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who would build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling the two towers between the two towers this bridge has <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body bumps against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which would have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't normally get into the water water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize the <unk> death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel on the bridge.
This is where most people have been before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day in bringing it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were <unk> but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22 last year when we have a call of a possible subject called a suicide bomber sitting at the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a official bridge <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times from New Jersey to try to get engaged from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on on the right, and it was.
This kind kind and intelligent kid in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason had been doing it.
<unk> damage damage a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it <unk>
What is <unk>
What does it say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen to.
And I'll listen to understanding.
Not <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it, because you probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, let's look at the similar circumstances have thought to end their life. You've had these <unk>
It would take the person in front of their life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends, you tell your friends, etc.
I am still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never came there.
I called the <unk> police and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness I'd seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful harbor not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his child took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call by a possible subject -- the <unk> <unk> near the north.
<unk> my bike.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
And for the hour and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day to come back on that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that he made it <unk> and gave it to hope and life else.
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I was left to speak and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the September events of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious, of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he says it.
We give God for you.
I really kept on debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of the end she writing, <unk> -- when I visited the General San Francisco Hospital that night, you walk into the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active <unk>
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, in spite of finishing their own pain, theft the chance to meet him.
This is what they do.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: <unk> drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly involved in -- just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man he talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> by hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few that have jumped from the bridge and <unk> and you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one on the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be working to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There's always hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but inside your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you get in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in that way.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that had been in a child.
My outside of the end of the end of my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons that I'm going to go back later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all care about our families, our religion, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color color or by the beliefs of those around us.
They're the people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent -- my agent -- I ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always was wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom said, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew so <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know it is something more complex and mystery here.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because it thought to be a bad thing, but how the world comes to those of us who want to take care of it.
I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, my father and a family who <unk> me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the African culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever participated in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she went over and she said that if she went over to the <unk> and <unk> and that night, and that night, I won in the bathroom, and he was a third <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they were <unk> in remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put my name on my name.
She also accompanied me when I was born in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated abandoned surgeries and secure surgeries.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary for surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity is meant to drive or be able to drive a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and to be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> lived his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
And every 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same time, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you -- <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. First of all, thank you for all my <unk>
I support my support network, my parents particularly in my family, which is very strong.
And I remember all the times that I've been <unk> young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it was -- other times -- it's not just identity identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to be a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table of the subject that sometimes a block, and there should be a space that allowed people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, and the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when it was <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National Prize for peace, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the very beginning, when when we first was born, a little girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not yet yet for his father or his mother.
<unk> comes to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, you get sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only is it suffering, but the daughter. The daughter was just <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At age five years old, when I should go to school, she stays home and the school insists their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it goes into the <unk> when it was 13 years old, you get to get them out of their home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that <unk> it could even kill them.
And it's interesting that this of the honor code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> also affecting the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters at the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
I'm supposed to be a good girl must be very humble and very <unk>
<unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It was supposed to be silent and who embrace the choices of their father and their mother and the <unk> decisions even if they didn't want to.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if I did it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
What happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> his daughter and the same lesson of honor to your children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot of before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was asked by all men, and I took my pen, and I got my <unk> and I wrote a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she grew, when I was four and a half years and a half years in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the societies, in societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for a young girl.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspiration where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of <unk> Canada, and I was in the relative to family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my teenage sisters in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for it, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the <unk> lesson.
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
We had <unk> brothers and sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, I got up and raised up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog blog for the BBC, she offered her for the New York documentaries Times and talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine of October 2012, was shot at the head of the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> in the life and death, I would tell my ear to my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please, don't happen to you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in the game because of peace, and because of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words are very much for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was spreading through my wife's face.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I am well with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get it right. Please do not move.
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women and women, it's like any 16 years old.
You know, when it doesn't end up their task.
He was fighting with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is the special thing in my <unk> which has made so audacious to <unk> so fearless and <unk>
I tell you, I'm not wondering what I did.
I don't really do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> the brain was 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still the same as smart or not?
Is it not going to be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what quantity to take, over a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if he didn't take anything, she would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to keep in life.
More than once I have saved a little bit of time.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the dose of <unk> because it really doesn't have a clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started to test with <unk> different <unk> and I was shocked to see how little changes in the dose of the dose -- drastically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had a typical dose and typical chemical <unk> for a <unk> man and I was shocked to see how to look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- for course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just wouldn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do -- since I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is that that <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
So let's think about it almost always in pictures, and that became my point of the key reference -- how to get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> saw things like this.
They thought that images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works. It's simple: for most of us, the mental images are really fundamental for <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I was able to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> and really <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to put these mental images in my mind on the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their own imagination only to lead to the world that has a way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in order to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to that with two recent experiments that were done by two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in neuroscience.
They both used <unk> MRI imaging to represent the brain. And you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the <unk> shows the brain of that same individual as they <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left. It looks that the difference is <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image as well.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
So let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large set of reactions from the brain to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images new animals, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information, and it <unk> it to show what seemed like the person was looking at it.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up to us.
We're right around doing this.
We only need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the <unk> brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and put electrodes.
I don't offer that for that.
A lot of people are proposing new measures of projection from imagery, even <unk> <unk> with the latest result of the MRI -- first we have to ask the next, this technology is going to be the end of the road.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, more <unk> magnets only offered little improvements in the resolution, not increases for thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI were to do really big, right?
But most of the most recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the <unk> and radio receivers in MRI systems.
At his time, instead of a magnetic field <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns -- by the frequencies of radio radius
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas in directly into the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe maybe say to some person for the first time you love, or say to somebody who's pregnant, or saying to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to put in your life.
And I can all have a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have gone out of that closet to be universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, and I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be dependent on the <unk> of my short-term pants and for having me <unk> the head of a little bit, I would ask you as a kid -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And he would find a uncomfortable silence, on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother was tossed a cold <unk>
But I would not say anything, and it <unk> inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was <unk> and I was about to walk into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
The <unk> in Gloria <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took a deep breath, and I went down and I went down and my back and my backs -- a little girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a <unk> <unk> just a girl with one question: "Are you guys or <unk>
And so I took a little bit of <unk> again, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and you saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
But I'm more than the kind of girl of a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all it -- they're just <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> which is <unk>
It was the most easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So how many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different than you or you or you or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons for why I went out of my closet it was harder than getting out of his, but this is the <unk> it is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared on bank rotates is harder than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult to say to your child from five years that are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just a difficult thing.
We must stop to classify what is difficult for another person to be difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than you give the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any child in the coffee <unk>
I was frozen in <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my full friends, strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to try and not <unk> and now the world would turn on to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was at my sister wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and I made my <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in my black and <unk> truck around the tables and finally came to a where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I found <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite agenda.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show you desperately to get their support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing <unk> party.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
And that's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves getting out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be the <unk> Just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, they <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of them can come out safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never excited about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not to you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And it may feel very aid, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the computer pioneered like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you're from a living race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the <unk> of the Earth or the Earth's intelligence -- but they have incredibly long telescopes, and they can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as we <unk> we know that the reason why we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're in a alien race that doesn't know about this, that doesn't have any concept about the Earth's intelligence -- it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question that the understanding of the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, toward a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finely honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that are universal as possible of possible future.
In the beginning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different topics, and we had <unk> together, and I said, for a number of years ago: there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force that intelligence is a force that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action or keeping the open options with a force T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time for the future <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping the options open.
And so having on account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Do you have the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> for their life should have a tendency to conditions more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only related to the production of entropy.
To find out, we developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy of long-term entropy in any system that you find in.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple testing of animal intelligence, play games, and even winning money -- actions, it all that they would have done that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically using a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that you can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability for cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game, against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see we see a new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network right connected.
This is the same capacity to filter it also has applications in healthcare, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and finding the success Canal to <unk> in the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and transportation and transportation.
Finally, here we see that we see that we will spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy on a set of <unk> negotiation in a series of simulated actions, successfully increasing the assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation and social cooperation and social cooperation -- and all of us have a system that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk>
The machines <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that machines are going to be smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that the general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals learn from this kind of <unk>
My suggestion to that statement to go through the descendants of that statement to help you build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand understanding human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they jam a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there is between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
At his time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of worlds that is potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale has gone very quickly our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not scientific and <unk> or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is little and <unk> and in spite of being a little further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface into the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> it like the <unk> mission to take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now have just short space flight but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still have been <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and lower places on Earth the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm is that this enthusiasm with the colonization of Mars and other planets to drag and the implication and the belief that Mars would expect in order to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
So so I like the <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for humanity is as to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of truth will be later on the <unk> --   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the Earth is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just found them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintaining <unk> spaces in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we could be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi did so many years ago, and I asked the realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become an advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that develop this development.
It is arrogant to think that just the colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and planetary exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to ensure the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the <unk> task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I was going to get my own home.
And while on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table at the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't come home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early in Europe in the next morning, and I would take my passport and my bag.
It was expensive, but it's sure that it wasn't more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, it was very moved.
I'm a head of a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rhythm, <unk> the level of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that could put on their place, which would have been going on bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen to be bad things to be a total of total catastrophe happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize for the Nobel Prize and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called the retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this one few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, an expert team comes from, and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to avoid the things that are going on or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you get a place for things that are completely <unk>
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish, that places the <unk> trees live, where the female tribes are in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that are moving too much.
This is the reason for losing keys from the reading and <unk>
So at the house of <unk> a place for the keys, a <unk> next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
To your passport, it is a particular core.
For your <unk> in reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it all the things you will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a photo of your credit card cards, you put them in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases your cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care, or the one to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making, and in fact for the making of financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that you have to take from what would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even likely you know to know people that <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask that most physicians don't want to talk, and companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have a surgery on any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't get me out of something if it wasn't to help me.
But the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's a fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We didn't understand very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only by 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> what believe it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This as the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I will explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 than my <unk>
Why isn't it <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic -- and it is, let's have the <unk> <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects is produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think of clarity.
So think about how we did this with time, so they don't have to make the chain of reasoning.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has five percent of the 300 side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug for the drug to help you.
I'm not saying they should or not take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
Social ethic it requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent first.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value for the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is more done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to try is <unk>
So this is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you get lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make is going to play the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain toward the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change it in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
You know, with a predatory face, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get to be lunch lunch so that none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to avoid the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor I installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key door to the front door, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smoothly.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never get a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came around during the 1800s, and over the time of time, it mixed with a local signs and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, you really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world -- is as if I lived in a foreign country, followed by a foreign country -- followed by their rules and <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do you understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It is <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can make sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't have the <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> from the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> for moving on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to make it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that struck me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Are I going to ask me more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel a <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, he was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that they could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose it to me.
There's a massive culture around the news language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me with equal and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with a lot of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could get it into the forget and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was shocked to see the similarities between music and the <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and completely expressing on paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so that you understand better how it works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in a lot of different backgrounds.
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as the facial expression, the shape of the body, the speed of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as the piano, the English is a linear, sort of <unk> just a button at once.
But the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a button would change the chord it would create a completely different meaning, it would create it.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal on that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
Uh oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> and you put it in.
This is the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the speed and <unk> it looks like a piece of music.
All day long.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
So this represents the time in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is two hands, the present is in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> rate.
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically to <unk>
You see <unk> right hand -- <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language language around the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third -- please get back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they transmit very different meanings together.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and pollinating as the music.
But today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn -- and I don't have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to give you your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> Hey, Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you do it, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance must say, because adults lie to us to protect us from the awful, truth.
As I was older, I found out that adults also find out that adults also <unk> and they're not very good to clean each other.
Time passed, now I'm an adult and teaching civil school to Hong Kong <unk>
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use that huge ships.
So together with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> labor with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it into the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do that.
I'll leave you with my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> it in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic bits, just <unk> information.
By using the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids are very excited about the robots.
Then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast at creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform lamps and web camera, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly by the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the plastic bits floating through the sensor, while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a rough estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else gets them to get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local issue, and they <unk> are trying to solve it immediately.
I am able to research my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news news, and the Internet, the Internet, and they <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning the oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water <unk> the water where they live in.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and oil is also brown color and when it all <unk> it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> across all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what there is in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we sent it into Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local issue, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in different children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to deal with a harder problem, and as close to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and the French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear central nuclear central to water.
And today, as the reports about the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has pretty safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research <unk> with other scientists, the land, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we got to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Along with them, we discussed the <unk> data, that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> so that we represent real-time data in the <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this organized a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear center to date.
We zoom in to 1.5 miles of nuclear center, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should go and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit like that, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into space in the largest space and the environmental impact on the environment.
It's at the heart of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal -- a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can actually build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible but the worst legacy we can leave our children are in the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So most scientists, creators, <unk> we must prepare to the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design cultures.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one single string of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is a place on the environment, the other thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the wrong <unk> he saw a figure that will struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But the living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information that we needed for every cell to work and to get it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and manufacturing production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world in place, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects as <unk> of different parts -- with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
You act mostly as a filter -- the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no place, no <unk>
It's a system that manages its functionality through variation by <unk>
Here is a divided screen that represents my vision of the <unk> and architect of every designer in the <unk> and the gene, where the gene is currently between the <unk> and the organism, between the assembly and growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions in the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and training is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at its most simple level, tries to bring these two visions in the world, moving from assembly and moving to growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
So why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird time, where they connect four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools like this robotic arm with a degree of 24 meters of scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> that some day not very far and print buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically engineered <unk> that glow in the dark.
So here we <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is just size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they are <unk> It's like a second <unk> skin of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing with <unk> 3D printing -- we print this layer and completely 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner too.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical analytical and <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair to the <unk> comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and to design this pattern of surface surface, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious home but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and get to define a lot of what I really care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, where leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world in the ground.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects were <unk>
Let's get a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the <unk> material the kind of material in the tree -- with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or crabs and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal.  We asked a lot of <unk> husks and we produced <unk> <unk>
We have chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
And to print the structures at a large scale, and they built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material -- 3.5 meters long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready -- it lets them dry it to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh and even worse, even more.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects that are designed for <unk> and put in the sea, and put it on the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of making clothes to keep the life for the <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created by <unk> made by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- new basic ideas inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, it was <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the soft water.
And the E. E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other takes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks at the <unk> tract that will help us have these bacteria and to make their own function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> to get more transparent channels.
This kind of digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> brilliant channels with life inside your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are last <unk> creatures only half is <unk>
What if design would be the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter of <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, the tissue will never be destroyed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer, you know a <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of a sophisticated home in which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm will first turn into the environment, it creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of understanding better how this complex process works, attach a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the worm.
But by putting the silk worm on a flat patch not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different across different cities, different <unk> and we've discovered that shape -- the <unk> structure of the <unk> was <unk> directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are going to death to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the brutal silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making templates and we put us on our site.
We knew that the silk worms are moving into the more dark and <unk> areas that's why we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, distributed silk worms over structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk with a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready for us with us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they were getting eggs, and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> biological silk on <unk> silk -- give all this <unk> this <unk>
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route of the silk path.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> of the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full full full of empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
The thing that brings us around -- of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature of design, which requires us, for the first time, that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever have asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and developed websites, the guitar in a band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I got excited about it, something completely different, and I would tell me about it, and I was going to get <unk> and I feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And then finally, I want to give it on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing to really deny all my other passions, and they would give <unk>
Another reason that I had so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for not <unk> at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of commitment, or being <unk> or <unk> or in my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to have a couple of a couple of time.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they did it, they learned about culture.
So what do you want to ask you first is, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would do to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in the children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
So this question is going to happen over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are going to pick them up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It happens from being the cute exercise before you take your dream.
Why?
If this matter is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, is not inspired by dreaming of everything you might be.
In fact, it does just the wrong thing, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't be able to respond with 20 different things, even though they will be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of destiny.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that bring up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so he said.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple <unk>
You can also use other kinds of terms that you would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
The ideal of the Renaissance, the ideal was that I was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> It comes to us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of fit to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned by talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their own shared interests in cartography, visualization, mathematics and design, to make <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of their <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
And so the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, they can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> it <unk> we are interested in it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to prove new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full time and independent artist.
As an amazing pianist had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned it into a writer -- <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the longest sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability to help write compelling launches for editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you would have to do with it, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's to say, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, some other website, <unk> -- sometimes a week of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, it feels like James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the market needs, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, rapid learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> on <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get out of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put into ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design life and racing lives that are connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to be more like their <unk>
I once said this, if there is one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with your inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart, then you get all the media.
That's where you will give the best thing.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have to realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman called <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a autopsy. And they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been living -- I would have been living today, we couldn't give her to the more help she was giving him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, tax <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include a lot of you.
If they expect to live to the 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that their <unk> are going to be <unk> or helping to take care of a friend or be dear Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs -- an increase in five times by 2050, as we get the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research in the fact that the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people knows, but the entire Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk> it.
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, scientists, mistake Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy human brain, compared to the disease of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces the hope of life and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and weird <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds like a origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> ends up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the dots are left out there.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like a bomb.
It was <unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the <unk> bomb.
You have to find the right step that I can do it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the cables and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, engineers, engineers, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, now it's testing a new kind of drugs that they jam specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that you stick with each other inside of them, like human Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see it <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial outcome -- but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we do it, we can <unk> it.
In the case of other disease, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain run at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
We had this article in the 20th column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is a psychological study that was designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience as we test it as a night of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get the <unk> and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you put it to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number three: <unk> I really <unk> <unk> your partner what you like about him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you just ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, one detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but then it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect to be <unk>
But nevertheless, it was <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the 15 column for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably are asking yourself, they continue to go together.
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends of Facebook and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that took a good eye burden in a relatively new relationship.
But as we had no idea.
The article came out on a Friday night, and on Saturday, he came up with my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called the "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million views, and I was -- I was to say something, a little technical, for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with participation -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they were doing the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox in my email for the phrase, <unk> <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on the radio and <unk>
I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately threw in red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers in proving the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to each petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I had <unk> interviews of television and <unk> the orders of all of us two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, most of all, that people posed the wrong question.
How do we know if you put it together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions that we think is less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for engaging in interpersonal college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds like romantic isn't it?
But the study did work.
The participants were more close after doing it. Several later studies, they also used the <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the members of the community and the community, and they used it among people from the <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately, he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person with whom you <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better after proving the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation going on.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to virtually all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I went through the science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized that at the moment I thought it was just for the book that I was writing for, but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used to be so bad.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what comes up.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably they can reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for the love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> endlessly by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The media that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some sense of risk -- and this is a very scary story, because in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that we ask, still together?
And his content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask you to make questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How can I stay in love when things get <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known study and we applied a study to create romantic love, we still get ourselves together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love with it, it's not the same as to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no thought everything that choice was supposed to do.
I didn't think so many times would we have both to make that decision, and how much times you will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always choice or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and <unk> 36 questions, I will have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I would argue, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit at the title of my paper, which is by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to make someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little lesbian on full <unk> and in a way I got like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time ago,  -- something that affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird humanoid or a few aliens found this box about 500 years later, and then <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
And at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go to <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a sort of <unk> <unk> -- and I took a kind of <unk> and I took a kind of <unk> and a bee was <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to be the opposite of the opposite of size, like it was going to get the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
So this time, I started to add some strange <unk> products, strange bottles that I could find out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> just like you do about a body of the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens themselves.
First of all, you will be able to get an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning a little bit of money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with a picture of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing in the glass, similar to the drawing in a window and then on a window and a window and had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 kilos.
5.5 meters long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
You're going from the world of representation -- this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are running the <unk> lists for suicide in mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> -- the bin bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
It was also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it turns out oil in a hand while the other hand is out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that keeps Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's peak of this <unk>
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go you already know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from suicide cards.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> in time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts like a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk with each other. It's bringing years old.
Each is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk>
I will see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and the <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two head, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange statue in.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a musician -- a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
You know, the box and all the people in the way it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you live in.
And together we came to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of borders, the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have the pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will impact the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug will be <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the <unk> cells.
But they are also known by their side effects effects on their most negative, because in time that you have to get to the stream to the stream, it will be <unk> and worse even for the time that you just take to your destination, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph lymph system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the bloodstream, of the patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the drug drugs that is a treatment for life running by the <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought to be able to get the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> surgery, they can be used for anything else, including the drug transport of medicines.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately the cells with HIV to introduce the medicines.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a small laser beam on the cellular membrane infected as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains a drug.
The laser passed through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll have a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this is not a lot of time.
But one day, if it has success, this technology can lead to the total eradication eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> drug organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
You know, what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to a better understanding of violence generators and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent participation.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of peace arrangements between 1975, and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a <unk>
So we must understand these <unk> we even have to be able to <unk> or <unk> in any process of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one actually analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more people more than just shooting.
They're multitasking here.
It <unk> a complex piece of communication stations, radio channels, online websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Those groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising but through <unk> businesses for building companies.
These are a key thing.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to make better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put their professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Those groups are also trying to conquer the population to offering something that the state didn't secure and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan occupied by the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also figure out the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price of the population.
But in general, to provide social services means to fill a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it enables these groups to strengthen their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 by Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in gaps in the government, and come up like armed groups, and political groups, involved in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can be <unk> as something else to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of an ground, they run all their <unk> they collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, without state and hybrids and the weakest the weak people are the states, like in the Middle East and <unk> that gap is the <unk> actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups have to invest more in the military tools.
We had that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace together.
If we understand better groups we will understand better what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safe security, to fill that governance that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> tag would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was excited about as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how they're treated all around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in <unk> that could be feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules that ask too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would be the same <unk> for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world as it is <unk> free or violence.
We have the right to use it in a easy way, and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing controls <unk> or doctrines or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap rap for all volume.
Although the letter modulation to women and it comes to me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> the yin yang of yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
Would you say, poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by musical storytelling.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the tasks -- but also killing insects, the signature of trash, and the <unk> maintenance and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from the fashion journals and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies for the fairy fairy fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, they accepted that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
We have this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically, the needs of color women, the gay workers, and <unk> for white women, <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good Feminism I'm a very bad feminist mark.
It also happens the following: <unk> feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> into a <unk>
We hope it was going to be <unk>
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I would have been <unk> from that <unk> before I tried to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what that <unk> means by fear of not being able to fulfill the little realistic.
Take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in front of the word <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star <unk> embrace the <unk> and to know to know the women and the young men who are a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began the endless debates if it was or not a feminist.
It would be able to get his success, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We have perfection perfection because we're still struggling for much, we want a lot, we need so much, we need so much.
We are going to be a lot beyond sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any wife, <unk> until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad deal or more good, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the <unk> and it will be a little <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make change affecting effectively their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does its music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions is that it makes it harder for women to make equality, gender that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two little girls, <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Where they were excited about the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the play.
We can change the position of radio when we hear the songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to try to participate in this kind of projects, we can also inspire them to be even more than even more like us to be empowered to overcome the barriers to the staff.
Because we are not <unk> it without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in the power directors and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to our work, well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few boys were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
It would take my voice, and after all I didn't tell me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
He read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
In writing and determination, I also found that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue <unk> I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most easily useless diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a half century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that broke the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines that and marked that by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in risk of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it create their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence kept stable only three or four children for each <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
It is being routinely known as <unk> <unk> refer to the autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could get it from another child in <unk>
What's going on here?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people from the Center for Disease Disease Disease Disease Disease -- what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "a better <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who's looking for her <unk> face, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out, why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened to have less than to do with slow progress.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake and the consequences of the same are having an devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins who looked at 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, including people around their own parents.
They could tickle hours for hours by waving their hands in their face, but they were prey to <unk> as when he doesn't put his favorite toy in its usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared you seen less than 150 cases of their syndrome as we had <unk> references as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that <unk> is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned to nine from every 10 children in their doctor's office, because being autistic and giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child abuse caused by cold and <unk> parents.
And these children said, they have been very carefully on a refrigerator that didn't exist.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to the institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was rare.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of mentor mothers was pretty stupid.
She and his husband was John <unk> and <unk> and had a deep autistic child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie! Without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand at the National Service, the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their colleague Judith Gould and his colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb from London called <unk> to try and find the autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the fact of autism was much more <unk> and diverse as autism was.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In the other way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful photographs, and <unk> like <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did no one didn't realize these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article that was published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then it was <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no even one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he was doing it for her.
The paper offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching kids with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the kids were still their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a living disability for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of trying to treat kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
The Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of hunger and disability.
He believed that autism, and the autistic traits were common and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> known in pop culture such as awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that they found the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes turned into <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a wide and transformative model.
These changes fell into a broken bag.
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith were working on <unk> these <unk> people around the world saw an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards on <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents from everyone knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trial to use to diagnose autism.
I wasn't supposed to have a connection with that little cycle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it was like that, so they were hoping that the people with autism, and their families finally went to support and services.
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> very simple, and <unk> credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the estimate is now at the center of the prevention of preventing children in the spectrum, are right in the spectrum, are right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people are <unk> on the Internet to reject the idea that they are inspired by the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a deficit <unk>
Of course, people are <unk> they have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching out to <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding the teachers, employers with skills, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We have all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we <unk> toward an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
