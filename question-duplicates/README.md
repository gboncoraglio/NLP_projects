## Question duplicates

The task of identifying duplicated questions can be viewed as an instance of the paraphrase identification problem.
There are many application such as in question-and-answer (QA) forums, there are vast numbers
of duplicate questions. Identifying these duplicates and consolidating their answers increases the
efficiency of such QA forums. Moreover, identifying questions with the same semantic content could
help web-scale question answering systems that are increasingly concentrating on retrieving focused
answers to usersâ€™ queries.
