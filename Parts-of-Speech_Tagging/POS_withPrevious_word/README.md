Project involving developing Hidden Markov Models for POS with the Viterbi algorithm.

This project was developed when studying for the course "Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models".

I highlt suggest reading chapter 8 of the 3rd edition of the book ["Speech and Language Processing", Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
which explain very well Part-of-Speech Tagging.
