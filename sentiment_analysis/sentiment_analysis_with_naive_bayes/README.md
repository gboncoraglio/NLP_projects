Performing Sentiment analysis of tweets using Naive Bayes. 
This project was done when studying from the notes of NLP course "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces", during week 2 of the course.

Highly suggested reading chapter 4 'Naive Bayes and Sentiment Classification' \
from the book "Speech and Language Processing" by D. Jurafsky and J. H. Martin 3rd Edition, \
which explain what I did in this project.
