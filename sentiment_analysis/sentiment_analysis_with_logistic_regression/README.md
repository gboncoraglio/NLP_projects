Performing Sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regressions. 
This project was done when studying from the notes of NLP course "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces", during week 1 of the course.

Highly suggested reading chapter 5 'Logistic Regression' \
from the book "Speech and Language Processing" by D. Jurafsky and J. H. Martin 3rd Edition, \
which explain what I did in this project.
